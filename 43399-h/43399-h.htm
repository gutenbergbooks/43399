<h3><i>July 12, 1915.</i></h3>


<h4>HUGH MONROE</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER an absence of many years, I have
returned to visit for a time my Blackfeet
relatives and friends, and we are
camping along the mountain trails where, in
the long ago, we hunted buffalo, and elk, and
moose, and all the other game peculiar to this
region.</p>

<p>To-day we pitched our lodges under Rising
Wolf Mountain, that massive, sky-piercing,
snow-crested height of red-and-gray rock which
slopes up so steeply from the north shore of Upper
Two Medicine Lake. This afternoon we saw
upon it, some two or three thousand feet up
toward its rugged crest, a few bighorn and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
Rocky Mountain goat. But we may not kill
them! Said Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill:
&ldquo;There they are! Our meat, but the whites
have taken them from us, even as they have
taken everything else that is ours!&rdquo; And so we
are eating beef where once we feasted upon the
rich ribs and loins of game, which tasted all the
better because we trailed and killed it, and with
no little labor brought it to the womenfolk in
camp.</p>

<p>Rising Wolf Mountain! What a fitting and
splendid monument it is to the first white man
to traverse the foothills of the Rockies between
the Saskatchewan and the Missouri! Hugh
Monroe was his English name. His father was
Captain Hugh Monroe, of the English army; his
mother was Am&eacute;lie de la Roche, a daughter of a
noble family of French <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i>. Hugh Monroe,
Junior, was born in Montreal in 1798. In 1814
he received permission to enter the employ of
the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, and one year
later&mdash;in the summer of 1815&mdash;he arrived at
its new post, Mountain Fort, on the North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
Fork of the Saskatchewan and close to the foothills
of the Rockies.</p>

<p>At that time the Company had but recently
entered Blackfeet territory, and none of its <i>engag&eacute;s</i>
understood their language; an interpreter
was needed, and the Factor appointed Monroe
to fit himself for the position. The Blackfeet
were leaving the Fort to hunt and trap along the
tributaries of the Missouri during the winter,
and he went with them, under the protection of
the head chief, who had nineteen wives and two
lodges and an immense band of horses. By easy
stages they traveled along the foot of the Rockies
to Sun River, where they wintered, and then in
the spring, instead of returning to the Saskatchewan,
they crossed the Missouri, hunted in the
Yellowstone country that summer, wintered on
the Missouri at the mouth of the Marias River,
and returned to Mountain Fort the following
spring with all the furs their horses could carry.</p>

<p>Instead of one winter, Monroe had passed two
years with the tribe, and in that time had acquired
a wife, a daughter of the great chief, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
good knowledge of the language, and an honorable
name, Ma-kwi&prime;-i-po-wak-s&#301;n (Rising Wolf),
which was given him because of his bravery in a
battle with the Crows in the Yellowstone country.</p>

<p>During Monroe&rsquo;s two years&rsquo; absence from the
Fort, another <i>engag&eacute;</i> had learned the Blackfeet
language from a Cree Indian, who spoke it well,
so that this man became the interpreter, and
Monroe was ordered to remain with the Piegan
tribe of the Blackfeet, to travel with them, and
see that they came annually to the Fort to trade
in the winter catch of furs. And this exactly
suited him; he much preferred roaming the plains
with his chosen people; the stuffy rooms of the
Fort had no attractions for a man of his nature.</p>

<p>How I envy Hugh Monroe, the first white
man to traverse the plains lying between the
Upper Saskatchewan and the Upper Missouri,
and the first to see many portions of the great
stretch of the mountain region between the
Missouri and the Yellowstone. He has himself
often told me that &ldquo;every day of that life was a
day of great joy!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
Monroe was a famous hunter and trapper, and
a warrior as well. He was a member of the Ai&prime;-in-i-kiks,
or Seizer band of the All Friends Society,
and the duty of the Seizers was to keep order in
the great camp, and see that the people obeyed
the hunting laws&mdash;a most difficult task at times.
On several occasions he went with his and other
bands to war against other tribes, and once, near
Great Salt Lake, when with a party of nearly
two hundred warriors, he saved the lives of the
noted Jim Bridger and his party of trappers.
Bridger had with him a dozen white men and as
many Snake Indians, the latter bitter enemies
of the Blackfeet. The Snakes were discovered,
and the Blackfeet party was preparing to charge
them, when Monroe saw that there were white
men behind them. &ldquo;Stop! White men are with
them! We must let them go their way in peace!&rdquo;
Monroe shouted to his party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are Snake white men, and therefore
our enemy: we shall kill them all!&rdquo; the
Blackfeet chief answered. However, such was
Monroe&rsquo;s power over his comrades that he finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
persuaded them to remain where they were, and
he went forward with a flag of truce, and found
that his friend Jim Bridger was the leader of the
other party. That evening white men and
Snakes and Blackfeet ate and smoked together!
It was a narrow escape for Bridger and his handful
of men.</p>

<p>Monroe had three sons and three daughters by
his Indian wife, all of whom grew into fine, stalwart
men and women. Up and down the country
he roamed with them, trapping and hunting, and
often fighting hostile war parties. They finally
all married, and in his old age he lived with one
and another of them until his death, in 1896, in
his ninety-eighth year. We buried him near the
buffalo cliffs, down on the Two Medicine River,
where he had seen many a herd of the huge animals
decoyed to their death. And then we named
this mountain for him. A fitting tribute, I think,
to one of the bravest yet most kindly men of the
old, old West!</p>


<p class="break">At the upper east side and head of this beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
lake rises a pyramidal mountain of great
height and grandeur. A frowse of pine timber on
its lower front slope, and its ever-narrowing side
slopes above, give it a certain resemblance to a
buffalo bull. Upon looking at a recent map of
the country I found that it had been named
&ldquo;Mount Rockwell.&rdquo; So, turning to Yellow Wolf,
I said: &ldquo;The whites have given that mountain
yonder the name of a white man. It is so
marked upon this paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man, half blind and quite feeble,
roused up when he heard that, and cried out:
&ldquo;Is it so? Not satisfied with taking our mountains,
the whites even take away the ancient
names we have given them! They shall not do
it! You tell them so! That mountain yonder is
Rising Bull Mountain, and by that name it
must ever be called! Rising Bull was one of our
great chiefs: what more fitting than that the
mountain should always bear his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rising Bull was a chief in two tribes,&rdquo; Yellow
Wolf went on. &ldquo;In his youth he married a
Flathead girl, at a time when we were at peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
with that people, and after a winter or two she
persuaded him to take her across the mountains
for a visit with her relatives. Rising Bull came
to like them and all the Flathead people so well
that he remained with them a number of winters,
and because of his bravery, and his kind and
generous nature, the Flatheads soon appointed
him one of their chiefs. When he was about
forty winters of age, some young men of both
tribes quarreled over a gambling game and several
were killed on each side. That, of course,
ended the peace pact; war was declared, and as
Rising Bull could not fight his own people, he
came back to us with his Flathead wife, and was
a leader in the war, which lasted for several
years. When that was ended, he continued to
lead war parties against the Crows, the Sioux,
the Assiniboines, and the far-off Snakes, and was
always successful. Came the dreadful Measles
Winter,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and with hundreds of our people, he
died. He left a son, White Quiver, a very brave
young warrior, and two years after his father&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
death, he was killed in a raid against the
Crows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ai! Rising Bull was a brave man. And oh,
so gentle-hearted! So good to the widows and
orphans; to all in any kind of distress! We must
in some way see that this mountain continues
to bear his name,&rdquo; said Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill.</p>

<p>And to that I most heartily agree.</p>


<h3><i>July 15.</i></h3>

<p>We are a considerable camp of people: Yellow
Wolf, my old uncle-in-law; Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill,
another uncle-in-law; Big
Spring; Two Guns; Black Bull; Stabs-by-Mistake;
Eagle Child; Eli Guardipe, or Takes-Gun-Ahead.
And with them they have their eleven
women and fourteen children. All are my especial
friends, and all the men have been to war&mdash;some
of them many times&mdash;and have counted
<i>coup</i> upon the enemy. Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill
has many battle scars on different
parts of his body. I was with him when he got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
the last one, in a fight with the Crees. The
bullet struck him in the forehead, ripped open
the scalp clear to the back of his head, but did
not penetrate the skull. He dropped instantly
when struck, and we at first thought that he was
dead. It was some hours before he regained
consciousness.</p>

<p>With all these men, and especially Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill
and Guardipe,
I hunted and traveled much in the old days.
Naturally, we spend much of our time telling
over this-and-that of our adventures. Meantime
the children play around, as happy as Indian
children ever are, and their mothers do the
lodge work, which is light, and gather in groups
to chat and joke. The boys have just been
skipping stones on the smooth surface of the
lake. The number of skips a stone makes before
it finally sinks, denotes the number of
wives the caster will have when he reaches
manhood.</p>

<p>Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill and Two
Guns are medicine men. The former has the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
Elk medicine pipe, the latter the Water medicine
pipe, both ancient medicines in the tribe.
They are spiritual, not material, medicines. In
fact, they are the implements used in prayers to
the sun and other gods, and each carries with it
a ritual of its own. Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill
has just told me that we will have some
prayers with his pipe a few days from now. I
shall be glad to take part in it all once more.</p>


<h3><i>July 16.</i></h3>

<p>Again my people are filled with resentment
against the whites. I told them this afternoon
that the falls in the river between this and
the lower lake had been given a foolish white
men&rsquo;s name. I could not tell them what it was,
for there is no Blackfeet equivalent for the word
&ldquo;Trick.&rdquo; But what a miserable, circus-suggesting
name that is to give to one of the most beautiful
of waterfalls, and the only one of its kind in
America, and in all the world, for all I know! A
short distance below the outlet of the upper lake
the river sinks, and a half-mile farther on gushes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
into sight from a jagged hole halfway up the side
of a high and almost perpendicular cliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the long ago we named that Pi&prime;tamakan
Falls,&rdquo; said Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes? And who was he?&rdquo; I asked, although
I had a fair recollection of the story of that personage.
But I had forgotten the details of it, and
wanted them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not he, but she!&rdquo; he corrected me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Pi&prime;tamakan (Running Eagle) is a man&rsquo;s
name,&rdquo; I objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True. But this woman earned the right to
bear a man&rsquo;s name, and so it was given her. She
was the only woman of our people to receive that
honor, so far as I know. Listen! You shall hear
all about it.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>THE WOMAN WHO EARNED A MAN&rsquo;S NAME</h4>

<p>&ldquo;As a girl, her name was Weasel Woman. She
was the eldest of two brothers and two sisters,
and when she had seen fifteen winters both their
father and mother died. But unlike children in
such circumstances, they did not give up their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
lodge and scatter out to live with relatives and
friends. Said Weasel Woman: &lsquo;Somehow, some
way, we can manage to live. You boys are old
enough to hunt and bring in meat and skins.
We three sisters will keep the lodge in good order,
and tan the skins for our clothing and bedding,
and other uses.&rsquo; And as she said, so it was
done, and the orphan family prospered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 482px;">
<a name="pitamakanfalls" id="pitamakanfalls"></a>
<img src="images/bt04.jpg" width="482" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">PI&prime;-TA-MAK-AN (RUNNING EAGLE) FALLS<br />
The greater part of the stream gushes from the orifice a third of the way up the cliff</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;But Weasel Woman was not satisfied. Many
young men and many old and rich men wanted
to marry her, and to all she said &lsquo;No!&rsquo; so loudly,
and so quickly, that after a time all knew that
she would not marry. Wherever a party of warriors
gathered for a dance or a feast, there she
was looking on, listening to their talk, and giving
what help she could. And when a party returned
from war, she was loudest in praising them. All
she talked of, all she thought about, was war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On an evening in her twentieth summer a
large party of warriors started out to cross the
mountains and raid the Flatheads. They traveled
all night, and when daylight came found
that Weasel Woman was with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Go back! Go home!&rsquo; the war chief told her.
But she would not listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you will not let me go with you, I shall
follow you,&rsquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then spoke up the medicine man of the
party: &lsquo;Chief,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I advise you to allow
her to go with us; something tells me that she
will bring us good luck.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! As you advise me, so shall it be,&rsquo; said
the war chief; and the woman went on with
them. No man of that party teased her, nor
bothered her in any way: every one of them
treated her as they would a sister. It was the
strangest war party that ever set forth from any
tribe of the plains!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was at the edge of Flathead Lake that
they discovered the enemy, a large camp of the
Flatheads and their friends, the Pend d&rsquo;Oreilles.
When night came they went close up to it, and
the woman said to the war chief: &lsquo;Let me go in
first. Let me see what I can do. I feel that I
shall be successful in there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go!&rsquo; the chief told her, &lsquo;and we will wait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
for you here, and be ready to help you if you get
into trouble.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman went into the camp, where all
the best horses of the people&mdash;their fast buffalo
runners, their racers, and their stallions&mdash;were
picketed close to the lodges of the different owners
of them. If she was afraid of being discovered
and killed, she never admitted it. The dying
moon gave light enough for her to see the
size and color of the horses. She took her time
and went around among them, and, making her
choice, cut the ropes of three fine pinto horses,
and led them out to where the party awaited
her. There she tied them, and went back into
camp with the chief and his men and again came
out with three horses. Said she then: &lsquo;I have
taken enough for this time. I will await you
here and take care of what we have.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men went back several times, and then,
having all the horses that they could drive rapidly,
the party struck for the mountains, and in
several days&rsquo; time arrived home without the loss
of a man or a horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
&ldquo;A few days after the party came into camp
the medicine lodge was put up, and on the day
that the warriors counted their <i>coups</i>, and new
names were given them, an old warrior and medicine
man called Weasel Woman before the people,
and had her count her <i>coup</i>&mdash;of going twice
into the enemy&rsquo;s camp and taking six horses. All
shouted approval of that, and then the medicine
man gave her the name, Pi&prime;-ta-mak-an, a very
great one, that of a chief whose shadow had
some time before gone on to the Sand Hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After that Pi&prime;tamakan, as we now may call
her, did not have to sneak after a party in order
to go to war with them: she was asked to go.
And after two or three more successful raids
against different enemies, the Crows, the Sioux,
and the Flatheads, she herself became a war
chief, and warriors begged to be allowed to join
her parties, because they believed that where she
led nothing but good luck would come to them.
She now wore men&rsquo;s clothing when on a raid.
At home she wore her woman clothing. But even
in that dress she, like any man, gave feasts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
dances, and the greatest chiefs and warriors
came to them, and were glad to be there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On her sixth raid, Pi&prime;tamakan led a large war
party against the Flatheads, and somewhere on
the other side of the mountains fell in with a
war party of Bloods, one of our brother tribes
of the North. For several days the two parties
traveled along together, and then one evening
the Blood chief, Falling Bear, said to Pi&prime;tamakan&rsquo;s
servant: &lsquo;Go tell your chief woman that I
would like to marry her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Chief, you do not understand,&rsquo; the boy told
him. &lsquo;She is not that kind. Men are her brothers,
and nothing more. She will never marry. I cannot
give her your message, for I am afraid that
she would be angry with me for carrying it to
her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the next day, as they were traveling
along, the Blood chief said to Pi&prime;tamakan: &lsquo;I
have never loved, but I love now. I love you;
my heart is all yours; let us marry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will not say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that, nor will I say
&ldquo;no,&rdquo;&rsquo; the woman chief answered him. &lsquo;I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
consider what you ask, and give you an answer
after we make this raid.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And with that the Blood chief said no more,
but felt encouraged: he thought that in time she
would agree to become his woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That very evening the scouts ahead discovered
a large camp of Flathead and Kootenai
Indians, more than a hundred lodges of them,
and when night came both parties drew close in
to it. Pi&prime;tamakan then ordered her followers to
remain where they were and told the Blood
chief to say the same thing to his men. She then
told the Blood chief to go into the camp and
take horses, and he went in and returned with
one horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is now my turn,&rsquo; said Pi&prime;tamakan, and
she went in and brought out two horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Blood chief went in and brought out
two horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pi&prime;tamakan went in and brought out four
horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Blood chief went in and brought out
two horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
&ldquo;Pi&prime;tamakan went in and brought out one
horse. And then she said to the Blood chief:
&lsquo;Our men are becoming impatient to go in
there and take horses. We will each of us go
in once more, and then let them do what they
can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the Blood chief went in for the fourth and
last time, and came back leading four horses,
making nine in all. And then Pi&prime;tamakan went
in and cut the ropes of eight horses, and safely
led them out, making in all fifteen that she had
taken. The warriors then went in, making several
trips, and then, with all the horses that
could be easily driven, the big double party
headed for home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the next day, as Pi&prime;tamakan and the
Blood chief were riding together, he said to her:
&lsquo;I love you so much that I can wait no longer
for my answer. Give it to me now. I believe
that you are going to say, &ldquo;Yes, I will be your
woman.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said Pi&prime;tamakan: &lsquo;I gave you your chance.
It would have been yes had you taken more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
horses than I did from the camp of the enemy.
But I took the most; therefore I cannot marry
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was her way of getting around saying
&lsquo;no&rsquo; to the chief. She had beaten him, an old,
experienced warrior, in the taking of the enemy&rsquo;s
horses, and he could not ask her again to become
his woman. It is said that he felt very badly
about it all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pi&prime;tamakan now carried a gun when she
went to war, and used it well in several fights
with the enemy, counting in all three <i>coups</i>,
each one of them the taking of a gun from the
man she herself killed. And then, <em>haiya</em>! On her
ninth raid she led a party against the Flatheads,
and while she and all her men were in the camp,
choosing horses and cutting their ropes, the Flatheads
discovered them and began firing, and she
and five of her men were killed. And so passed
Pi&prime;tamakan, virgin, and brave woman chief of
our people. She died young, about seventy
winters ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="break"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
Okan, his vision, is the name the Blackfeet
have for the great lodge which they annually
give to the sun, and for the four days of ceremonies
attending its erection and consecration.
In our vernacular it is the medicine lodge. I
asked Yellow Wolf this afternoon why this river
was named Nat&prime;-ok-i-o-kan, or, as we say, Two
Medicine Lodge River, and he replied that when
the Blackfeet first took this great country from
the Crows, they built a medicine lodge on the
river, just below the buffalo cliffs. The next
summer they built another one in the same place,
and owing to that the river got its name.</p>

<div class="caption">AT UPPER TWO MEDICINE LAKE<br />
Left to right: Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill, Yellow Wolf, and the author, relating his
killing of a grizzly at this particular place, in the long-ago</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, this was once the country of the Crows.
But the Blackfeet saw and coveted it. It was
about two hundred years ago, as near as I can
learn, that they came into it from their original
home, the region of Peace River and the Slave
Lakes, and little by little forced the Crows southward
until they had driven them to the south
side of the Yellowstone, or Elk River, as it is
known to the various Indian tribes of the
plains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
Perhaps, in the first place, the Blackfeet coveted
more than anything else the cliffs on the
Two Medicine,&mdash;just above Holy Family Mission,&mdash;where
the buffalo were decoyed in great
numbers and stampeded in a huge waterfall of
whirling brown bodies to death on the rocks
below.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet call such a place&mdash;there were
several of them&mdash;a <i>pi&prime;skan</i>, a trap. Extending
back from the cliff, for a mile or more out on
the plain, were two ever-diverging lines of rock
piles, like a huge letter V. Behind these the
people concealed themselves, and the buffalo
caller, going out beyond the mouth of the V, by
certain antics and motions aroused the curiosity
of the herd until it finally followed him into the
V. Then the people began to rise up behind it,
and the result was that, unable to turn either to
the right or left, from fear of the two lines of
shouting, robe-waving stampeders, it was driven
straight to the cliff and over it.</p>

<p>When I first saw the place, there were at the
foot of the cliffs tons and tons of buffalo horn tips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
the most time-resisting of any portion of a
buffalo&rsquo;s anatomy.</p>


<p class="break">Last night, while the pipe was going the
rounds, I asked what had become of old Red
Eagle&rsquo;s Thunder Medicine Pipe, and was told
that it was still in the tribe, Old Person at
present being the owner of it. Said Two Guns:
&ldquo;That is one of the most ancient and most
powerful medicines we have. Do you know how
it came into our possession?&rdquo;</p>


<h4>THE STORY OF THE THUNDER MEDICINE</h4>

<p>&ldquo;It was in the long ago. Our fathers had no
horses then, but used dogs to carry their belongings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One spring, needing the skins of bighorn to
tan into soft leather for clothing, the tribe moved
up here to the foot of the Lower Two Medicine
Lake, and began hunting. Many men would
surround and climb a mountain, driving the bighorn
ahead of them, their dogs helping, and at
last they would come up to the game, often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
several hundred head, on the summit of the
mountain. The dogs were then held back, and
the hunters, advancing with ready bow and
arrows, would shoot and shoot the bighorn at
close range and generally kill the most of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, while most of the men were hunting,
three young, unmarried women went out to
gather wood, and while they were collecting it
in little piles here and there, a thunderstorm
came up. Then said one of them, a beautiful
girl, tall, slender, long-haired, big-eyed, &lsquo;O Thunder!
I am pure! I am a virgin! If you will not
strike us I promise to marry you whenever you
want me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder passed on, not harming them, and
the young women gathered up their firewood
and went home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On another day these three young women
went out again for firewood, one ahead of another
along the trail in the deep woods, and
Mink Woman, she who had promised herself to
Thunder Man, was last of the three. She was
some distance behind the others and singing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
happily as she stepped along, when out from the
brush in front of her stepped a very fine-looking,
beautifully dressed man, and said: &lsquo;Well, here I
am. I have come for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, not for me! You are mistaken. I am
not that kind; I am a pure woman,&rsquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t go back on your word. You
promised yourself to me if I would not strike
you, and I did not harm you. Don&rsquo;t you know
me? I am Thunder Man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mink Woman looked closely at him, and her
heart beat fast from fear. But he was good to
look at, he had the appearance of a kind and
gentle man, and&mdash;although thoughtlessly&mdash;she
had made a promise to him, a god, and she could
not break it. So she answered: &lsquo;I said that I
would marry you. Well, here I am, take me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her two companions had passed on; they
saw nothing of this meeting. Thunder Man
stepped forward, and kissed her, then took her
in his arms, and, springing from the ground,
carried her up into the sky to the land of the
Above People.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
&ldquo;But the two young women soon missed her.
They ran back on the trail, and searched on all
sides of it, and called and called to her, and of
course got no reply: &lsquo;She may have gone home
for something,&rsquo; said one of them, and they hurried
back to camp. She was not there. They
then gave the alarm, and all the people scattered
out to look for her. They hunted all that day,
and wandered about in the woods all night, calling
her name, and got no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning Mink Woman&rsquo;s father,
Lame Bull, made medicine and called in Crow
Man, a god who sometimes lived with the people.
&lsquo;My daughter, Mink Woman, has disappeared,&rsquo;
he told the god. &lsquo;Find her, even learn where she
went, and you shall have her for your wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I take your word,&rsquo; Crow Man answered him.
&lsquo;I believe that I can learn where she went. I may
not be able to get her now, but I will some
time, and then you will not forget this promise.
I have always wanted her for my woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crow Man went to the two young women
and got them to show him where they had last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
seen Mink Woman. He then called a magpie to
him, and said to the bird: &lsquo;Fly around here and
find this missing woman&rsquo;s trail.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bird flew around and around, Crow Man
following it, and at last it fluttered to the ground,
and looked up at him, and said: &lsquo;To this spot
where I stand came the woman, and here her
trail ends.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it so!&rsquo; Crow Man exclaimed. &lsquo;Well
stand just where you are and move that long,
shining black tail of yours. Move it up and
down, and sideways. Twist it in every direction
that you can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The magpie did as he was told, and Crow
Man got down on hands and knees, and went
around, watching the shifting, wiggling, fanning
tail. Suddenly he cried out: &lsquo;There! Hold your
tail motionless in just that position!&rsquo; and he
moved up nearer and looked more closely at it.
The sun was shining brightly upon it, and the
glistening black feathers mirrored everything
around. They were now spread directly behind
the bird&rsquo;s body, and reflected the tree-tops, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
the sky beyond them. Long, long, Crow Man
stared at the tail, the people looking on and holding
their breath, and at last he said to Lame Bull,
&lsquo;I can see your daughter, but she is beyond my
reach: I cannot fly there. She is up in sky land,
and Thunder Man has her!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Ai! Ai!</em> She did promise herself to him the
other day, if he would spare us,&rsquo; one of the two
wood gatherers said, &lsquo;but she did not mean it;
she was only joking. It is no joke!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lame Bull sat down and covered his head
with his robe, and wept, and would not be comforted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder Man took Mink Woman to sky
land with him, and somehow, from the very first
she was happy there with him; she seemed to
forget at once all about this earth and her
parents and the people. It was a beautiful land
up there: warm and sunny, a country just like
ours except that it had no storms. Buffalo and
all the other animals covered the plains, and all
sorts of grasses and trees and berry-bushes and
plants grew there as they do here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
&ldquo;But although Mink Woman was very happy
there, Thunder Man was always uneasy about
her, and kept saying to his people, &lsquo;Watch her
constantly; see that she gets no hint of her
country down below, nor sight of it. If she does,
then she will cry and cry, and become sick, and
that will be bad for me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder Man was often away, and during
his absence his people kept a good watch on
Mink Woman, and did all they could to amuse
her; to keep her interested in different things.
One day a woman gave her some freshly dug
<i>mas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and she cried out: &lsquo;Oh, how good of you
to give me these! I must go dig some for myself!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
<i>Mas.</i> I know not the English name for this edible root.

</div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, no! Don&rsquo;t go! We will dig for you all
that you can use,&rsquo; the women told her, but she
would not listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want the fun of digging them for myself,&rsquo;
she told them. &lsquo;Somewhere, some time back, I
did dig them. I must dig them again.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, if you must, you must,&rsquo; they answered,
and gave her a digging stick, and cautioned her
not to dig a very large one, should she find it, for
that <i>mas</i> was the mother of all the others, and
was constantly bringing forth new ones by scattering
her seed to the winds. She promised that
she would not touch it, and went off happily
with her digging stick and a sack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mink Woman wandered about on the
warm grass and flower-covered plain, digging a
<i>mas</i> here, one there, singing to herself, and thinking
how much she loved her Thunder Man, and
wishing that he would be more often at home.
He was away the greater part of the time. Thus
wandering, in a low place in the plain she came
upon a <i>mas</i> of enormous size; actually, it was
larger around than her body! &lsquo;Ha! This is the
mother <i>mas</i>; the one they told me not to dig up,&rsquo;
she cried, and walked around and around it,
admiring its hugeness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I would like to dig it, but I must not,&rsquo; she
at last said to herself, and went on, seeking more
<i>mas</i> of small size. But she could not forget the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
big one; she kept imagining how it would look
out of the ground; on her back; in her lodge, all
nicely cleaned and washed, a present for Thunder
Man when he should return home. She went
back to it, walked around it many times, went
away from it, trying to do as she had been told.
But when halfway home she could no longer
resist the temptation: with a little cry she turned
and never stopped running until she was beside
it, and then she used the digging stick with all
her strength, thrusting it into the ground around
and around and around the huge growth and
prying up, and at last it became loose, and seizing
it by its big top leaves, she pulled hard and
tore it from the ground, and rolled it to one side
of the hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a big hole it was! And light seemed to
come up through it. She stepped to the edge
and looked down: upon pulling up the huge
<i>mas</i> she had torn a hole clear through the sky
earth! She stooped and looked through it, and
there, far, far below, saw&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, everything came back to her when she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
looked through it: There it was, her own earth
land! There was the Two Medicine River, and
there, just below the foot of its lower lake, was
the camp of her people! She threw away her
digging stick, and her sack of <i>mas</i>, and ran crying
to camp and into Thunder Man&rsquo;s lodge. He
was away at the time, but some of his relatives
were in the lodge, and she cried out to them:
&lsquo;I have seen my own country; the camp of my
people. I want to go back to them!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said Thunder Man&rsquo;s relatives to one another:
&lsquo;She has found the big <i>mas</i>, and has
pulled it up, and made a hole in our sky earth!
Now, what shall we do? Thunder Man will be
angry at us because we did not watch her more
closely.&rsquo; Thinking of what he might do to them
in his anger, they trembled. They tried to soothe
Mink Woman, but she would not be comforted;
she kept crying and crying to be taken back to
her father and mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder Man came home in the evening,
and upon learning what had happened, his distress
was as great as that of Mink Woman, whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
he loved. When he came into the lodge she threw
herself upon him, and with tears streaming from
her eyes, begged him to take her back to her
people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you love me?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t
you been happy here? Isn&rsquo;t this a beautiful&mdash;a
rich country?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course I love you! I have been happy
here! This is a good country! But oh, I want to
see my father and mother!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sleep now. In the morning you will
likely feel that you are glad to be here, instead of
down on the people&rsquo;s earth,&rsquo; Thunder Man told
her. But she would not sleep; she cried all night;
would not eat in the morning, and kept on crying
for her people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then said Thunder Man: &lsquo;I cannot bear to
see&mdash;to hear such distress. Because I love her,
she shall have her way. Go, you hunters, kill
buffalo, kill many of them, and bring in the
hides. And you, all you women, take the hides
and cut them into long, strong strips and tie
them together.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
&ldquo;This the hunters and the women did, and
Thunder Man himself made a long, high-sided
basket of a buffalo bull&rsquo;s hide and willow sticks.
This and the long, long one-strand rope of
buffalo hide were taken to the hole that Mink
Woman had torn in the sky earth, and then
Thunder Man brought her to the place and laid
her carefully in the basket, which he had lined
with soft robes: &lsquo;Because I love you so dearly,
I am going to let you down to your people,&rsquo; he
told her. &lsquo;But we do not part forever. Tell your
father that I shall soon visit him, and give him
presents. I know that I did wrong, taking you
from him without his consent. Say to him that
I will make amends for that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, you are good, and I love you more than
ever. But I must, I must see my people; I cannot
rest until I do,&rsquo; Mink Woman told him, and
kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people then swung the woman in the
basket down into the hole she had torn in the
earth, and began to pay out the long rope, and
slowly, little by little, the woman, looking up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
saw that she was leaving the land of the sky gods.
Below, the people, looking up, saw what they
thought was a strange bird slowly floating down
toward them from the sky. But after a long
time they knew that it was not a bird. Nothing
like it had ever been seen. It was coming down
straight toward the center of the big camp.
Men, women, children, they all fled to the edge
of the timber, the dogs close at their heels, and
from the shelter of thick brush watched this
strange, descending object. It was a long, long
time coming down, twirling this way, that way,
and swaying in the wind, but finally it touched
the ground in the very center of the camp circle,
and they saw a woman rise up and step out of it.
They recognized her: Mink Woman! And as
they rushed out from the timber to greet her,
the basket which had held her began to ascend
and soon disappeared in the far blue of the
sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the rest of that day and far into the
night, Mink Woman told her parents and her
people about the sky gods and the sky earth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
and even then did not tell it all. Days were
required for the telling of all that she had seen
and done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not long after Mink Woman&rsquo;s return to the
earth and her people, Thunder Man came to the
camp. He came quietly. One evening the door
curtain of Lame Bull&rsquo;s lodge was thrust aside,
and some one entered. Mink Woman, looking
up from where she sat, saw that it was her sky
god husband. He was plainly dressed, and bore
a bundle in his arms: &lsquo;Father!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;here
he is, my Thunder Man!&rsquo; And Lame Bull,
moving to one side of the couch, made him
welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said Thunder Man: &lsquo;I wronged you by
taking your daughter without your permission.
I come now to make amends for that. I have
here in this bundle a sacred pipe; my Thunder
pipe. I give it to you, and will teach you how
to use it, and how to say the prayers and sing
the songs that go with it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said Lame Bull to this man, his sky god
son-in-law, &lsquo;I was very angry at you, but as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
snow melts when the black winds<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> blow, so has
my anger gone from my heart. I take your
present. I shall be glad to learn the sacred songs
and prayers.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
The &ldquo;Chinook&rdquo; wind. It is generally accompanied by
dense black clouds that obscure the mountains. <a href="#FNanchor_3">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder Man remained for some time,
nearly a moon, there in Lame Bull&rsquo;s lodge, and
taught the chief the ceremony of the medicine
pipe until he knew it thoroughly in its every part.
&lsquo;It is a powerful medicine,&rsquo; Thunder Man told
him. &lsquo;It will make the sick well; bring you and
your people long life and happiness and plenty,
and success to your parties who go to war.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as he said it was, so it proved to be, a
most powerful medicine for the good of the
people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder Man&rsquo;s departure from the camp
was sudden and unexpected. One evening he
was sitting beside Mink Woman in Lame Bull&rsquo;s
lodge, and all at once straightened up, looked
skyward through the smoke hole, and appeared
to be listening to something. The people there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
in the lodge held their breath and listened also,
and could hear nothing but the chirping of the
crickets in the grass outside. But Thunder Man
soon cried out: &lsquo;They are calling me! I have to
go! I shall return to you as soon as I can finish
my work!&rsquo; And with that he ran from the lodge
and was gone. And Mink Woman wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can know the ways of the gods? Surely
not us of the earth. Thunder Man promised
to return soon, but moons passed, two winters
passed, and he came not to Lame Bull&rsquo;s lodge
and his woman. But soon after he left so suddenly,
Crow Man returned from far wanderings
and heard all the story of the god and Mink
Woman. He made no remark about it, but
spent much time in Lame Bull&rsquo;s lodge. Then,
after many moons had passed, he said to the
chief one day: &lsquo;Do you remember what you once
promised me? When your daughter so suddenly
disappeared you promised that if I would
even find her, or tell you whither she had gone,
you would give her to me when she was found.
Well, here she is: fulfill your promise!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;But she is no longer mine to give. She now
belongs to Thunder Man,&rsquo; the chief objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me tell you this,&rsquo; said Crow Man:
&lsquo;You promised to give her to me if I would even
tell you where she had gone. I did that. And
now, as to this Thunder Man, he will never
return here because he knows that I am in the
camp, and he fears me. So you might as well give
me your daughter now, as you will anyhow later.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ask her if she will marry you. I agree to
whatever she chooses to do,&rsquo; Lame Bull answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crow Man went outside and found Mink
Woman tanning a buffalo robe: &lsquo;I have your
father&rsquo;s consent to ask you to marry me. I hope
that you will say yes. I love you dearly. I will
be good to you,&rsquo; he told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mink Woman shook her head: &lsquo;I am already
married. My man will soon be coming
for me,&rsquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But if he doesn&rsquo;t come, will you marry
me?&rsquo; Crow Man asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We will talk about that later. I will say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
now, though, that I like you very much. I have
always liked you,&rsquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More moons passed, and as each one came,
Crow Man never failed to ask Mink Woman to
marry him. She kept refusing to do so. But
after two winters had gone by, and Thunder
Man still failed to appear and claim her, why,
her refusals became faint, and fainter, until,
finally, she would do no more than shake her
head when asked the great question. Then, at
last, in the Falling Leaves moon of the second
summer, when Crow Man asked her again, and
she only shook her head, he took her hand and
raised her up and drew her to him and whispered:
&lsquo;You know now that that sky god is
never coming for you. And you know in your
heart that you have learned to love me. Come,
you are now my woman. Let us go to my lodge,
my lodge which is now your lodge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And without a word of objection Mink
Woman went with him. Ai! She went gladly!
She was lonely, and she had for some time loved
him, although she would not acknowledge it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
&ldquo;It was a good winter. Buffalo were plentiful
near camp all through it, and Crow Man kept
the lodge well supplied with fat cow meat. He
and Mink Woman were very happy. Then came
spring, and one day, in new green grass time,
Thunder Man was heard approaching camp,
and the people went wild with fear; they believed
that he would destroy them all as soon
as he learned that Mink Woman had married
Crow Man. They all crowded around his lodge,
begging him to give her up, to send her at once
back to her father&rsquo;s lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Crow Man only laughed: &lsquo;I will show
you what I can do to that sky god,&rsquo; he told
them, and got out his medicines and called
Cold-Maker to come to his aid. By this time
Thunder Man was come almost to camp; was
making a terrible noise just overhead. But Cold-Maker
came quickly, came in a whirling storm
of wind and snow. Thunder Man raged, shooting
lightning, making thunder that shook the
earth. Cold-Maker made the wind blow harder
and harder, so that some of the lodges went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
down before it, and he caused the snow to swirl
so thickly that the day became almost as dark
as night. For a long time the two fought, lightning
against cold, thunder against snow, and
little by little Cold-Maker drove Thunder Man
back: he could not face the cold, and at last he
fled and his mutterings died away in the distance.
He was gone!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There! I told you I could drive him away,&rsquo;
said Crow Man. &lsquo;Mink Woman, you people all,
rest easy: Thunder Man will never again attempt
to enter this camp.&rsquo; And with that he
told Cold-Maker that he could return to his
Far North home. He went, taking with him his
wind and storm. The sun came out, the people
set up their flattened lodges, and all were once
more happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Lame Bull, he retained the pipe, and
found that its medicine was as strong as ever.
And from him it had been handed down from
father to son and father to son to this day, and
still it is strong medicine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kyi! That was the way of it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>II<br />
<span class="smcap">Pu-nak&prime;-ik-si (Cutbank)</span></h2>


<h3><i>July 18.</i></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>OWN came our lodges this morning, and
to-night we are camped in Cutbank
Canyon, just below the great beaver
ponds some six or seven miles from the head of
the stream. When I first saw these ponds, years
and years ago, they were dotted with beaver
houses, and at dusk one could see the busy woodcutters
swimming from them in all directions to
get their evening meal of willow or quaking
aspen bark, preparatory to beginning their
nightly work of storing food for winter use. I
never killed a beaver, but I have torn down
beaver dams in order to watch the little animals
repair them. Beavers have a language as well as
men: there was always a chief engineer who told
the workers just what to do, and he himself
rectified their mistakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
We are encamped right on the main war road
of the Blackfeet into the country of the West
Side tribes. Once, when camped here with the
Small Robes (I-nuk&prime;-siks), the band, or gens, of
which I was a member, I saw a party of our
young men make their preparations and start
westward on a raid. They gathered in a sweat
lodge with an old medicine man, who prayed
earnestly for their success while he sprinkled the
hot rocks with water, and dense steam filled the
place. And at dusk, carrying in painted rawhide
cylinders their war finery, and in little sacks
their extra moccasins, awl and sinew for repairs,
and their little paint bags, they stole out in
single file from the camp and headed for the
summit of the range.</p>

<p>Every evening, during their absence, the old
medicine man rode all through the camp, shaking
his medicine rattles, singing the song for the
absent, calling over and over each one&rsquo;s name,
and praying for his safe return.</p>

<p>And then, one morning some two weeks later,
they came into camp with a rush, driving before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
them sixty or seventy horses that they had
taken from the Kootenais. And two carried a
slender wand from which dangled a scalp. They
came in singing the song of victory; and then
the war chief shouted: &ldquo;A multitude of the
enemy are on our trail. Break camp, you women,
and move down river. Take your weapons, you
men, and turn back with us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We took our weapons. We mounted our
horses and rode like mad up the old war trail,
and within a half-hour sighted the enemy, forty
or fifty of them, strung out in a long, straggling
line, according to the strength and speed of each
one&rsquo;s horse. We exchanged a few shots with the
lead riders; one fell; the rest took their back
trail, and how they did go up the steep incline
to the summit, and over it. We did not pursue
them: &ldquo;Let them go!&rdquo; Bear Chief shouted. &ldquo;We
have many of their horses; we have scalped
three of them; let them go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We &ldquo;let them go!&rdquo; and, indeed, that was the
wiser way: they could have made a stand at the
summit and shot us down as fast as we came on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
The old war road! How many of my people
have traveled over it, some of them never to
return. It was along this road that Pi&prime;tamakan,
virgin woman warrior, led her warriors in what
was to be her last raid! But how many, many
times our people have come rushing homeward
over it, singing their songs of victory, waving
the scalps they have taken, and driving before
them great bands of the horses of the Pend
d&rsquo;Oreilles, the Snakes, the Nez Perc&eacute;s, and other
tribes of the Columbia River watershed.</p>

<p>The names the Blackfeet have given to the
four world directions are most significant of their
entry into this Missouri River country. North is
<i>ap-ut&prime;-o-sohts</i>: back, or behind direction. South,
<i>ahm-ska&prime;-pohts</i>, is ahead direction. East is <i>pi-na&prime;-pohts</i>:
down-river direction; and west is <i>ah-me&prime;-tohts</i>:
up-river direction. I have told why the
Two Medicine was so named, when the Blackfeet
came into the country from the Far North,
and drove the Crows before them. This river
they named Pu-nak&prime;-ik-si (Cutbank), because
its narrow valley for a long way up from its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
junction with the Two Medicine is walled in by
straight-cut cliffs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">OUR CAMP ON CUTBANK RIVER<br />
On left is O-nis-tai&prime;-mak-an (Wonderful Runner), and on right, Ki-nuk&prime;-sa-po-pi (Little Plume Mountain)
</div>
</div>

<p>The Cutbank River Valley, like those of all
the other streams of the country, has been the
scene of many a fight between the Blackfeet
and their enemies, in which the Blackfeet were
generally the victors. A remarkable instance of
an old woman&rsquo;s bravery occurred just below here
some forty years ago.</p>

<p>A few lodges of the Kut&prime;-ai-im-iks, or Never
Laughs band of the Blackfeet, in need of the
skins of elk and bighorn for making &ldquo;buckskin&rdquo;
for light clothing and moccasin tops, were here
hunting, and one evening all the men gathered
in old Running Crane&rsquo;s lodge for prayers with
his beaver medicine. An old woman, named
Muk-sin-ah&prime;-ki (Angry Woman), was sitting in
her lodge by herself because there had not been
room for her in the crowded beaver medicine
lodge. But she was listening to the distant singing,
and saying over the prayers at the proper
time, her heart full of peace and love for the
gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
As she sat there at the back of the lodge, she
suddenly noticed that the doorway curtain in
the upper part was being slowly pulled aside to
the width of a hand, and in that small space an
eye glared at her for a time, and then the curtain
dropped back to place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the eye of an enemy,&rdquo; she said to
herself. Her heart throbbed painfully; and for
the time her thoughts were confused. Then,
suddenly, some one, perhaps the sun himself,
told her to take courage. She took courage: she
stole out of the lodge to see what that enemy
was doing. There was a moon; bright starlight;
the night was almost as light as day; and she
had no more than left the lodge than she saw
the man walking here, there, examining the
buffalo runners, the best and swiftest horses of
the people, all picketed close to the lodges of
their owners. Whenever the man&rsquo;s back was
toward her, she hurried her steps; got closer and
closer to him; and then, suddenly, she sprang
and seized him from behind and shouted:
&ldquo;Help! Help! I have seized an enemy!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
In the beaver medicine lodge the men heard
her and came running to her relief. She had the
man down; he was struggling to rise; but the
sun must have given her of his power: she held
him firmly until they came, and they seized him,
and White Antelope stabbed him to death. He
was a Gros Ventre.</p>


<h4>HOW MOUNTAIN CHIEF FOUND HIS HORSES</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Nephew, listen! Magic took place here in
the long ago,&rdquo; said Yellow Wolf as we sat around
his lodge fire this evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ah&prime;-pai-tup-i<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> were hunting on this Cutbank
stream, every day or two moving nearer
and nearer to the mountains. At one of their
camping-places some distance below here, Mountain
Chief lost his two fast buffalo runners, and
although all the young men of the camp scattered
out to look for them, they could not be
found. Camp was moved nearer to the mountains,
and after a few days moved again, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
time to this very place where we are now encamped.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
Ah&prime;-pai-tup-i (Blood People). One of the twenty-four
gentes of the Pi-kun&prime;-i, or &ldquo;Piegan&rdquo; Blackfeet. <a href="#FNanchor_4">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The loss of the two buffalo runners was all
that Mountain Chief could think about. As
they could not be found, he felt sure that some
enemy had stolen them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a Kootenai Indian visiting in
camp, and one day he entered Mountain Chiefs
lodge, and said to him: &lsquo;You are grieving about
the loss of your two fast horses. Now, if you will
do as I say, perhaps I can find them for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whatever you ask, that shall be done,&rsquo;
Mountain Chief told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;First, then, you must give me a robe, a
good bow, and a quiver of arrows,&rsquo; said the
Kootenai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are yours; there they are: my own
weapons, that robe. Take them when you want
them,&rsquo; said the chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will take them later,&rsquo; said the Kootenai.
&lsquo;And now, call in your leading men.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mountain Chief went outside and shouted
the names of the men he wanted: a medicine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
man; several old, wise men; some warriors of
great name. They came and were given seats in
his lodge, each man according to his standing in
the tribe. Said the Kootenai then: &lsquo;I have a
sacred song that I want you all to learn. I will
sing it over three or four times, then you sing it
with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sang the song. It was low in tone, and
slow; a strange and beautiful song that gripped
one&rsquo;s heart. But it was not hard to learn; after
the Kootenai had sung it over four times, all
there could sing it with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the Kootenai told Mountain Chief to
have the women build for him a little lodge there
inside the big lodge. This they did by leaning
the sticks of two tripods against one of the poles
of the lodge, their lower ends making a half-circle,
and then covering them with buffalo
leather. Into this little enclosure crept the
Kootenai, taking with him a bird wing-bone
whistle, and a medicine rattle, and as soon as
he was inside he ordered the women to smooth
down carefully the leather coverings so that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
would be in the dark. He then said to the
people, sitting there in the big lodge: &lsquo;We will
now sing the song four times. It is a call song
to all living things: the birds, the animals, the
trees, the rocks&mdash;yes, even they have life. All
will come when we sing this song, and we will
question them as to the whereabouts of the two
missing horses.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sang the song four times, and then the
Kootenai, alone in his dark little lodge, sang
another song, keeping time to it with his rattle,
and the people, listening, heard outside the sighing
of the wind through a big pine tree, although
no such tree was near; and the Kootenai questioned
the pine tree, and it answered that it had
no knowledge of the missing horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, at his summons, came the different
birds and the animals; one could hear outside
the flutter of their wings, the tread of their feet;
and the Kootenai questioned them, and one by
one they answered that they had not seen the
horses. Came then a big rock, hurtling down
through the sky and through the smoke hole of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
the lodge right into the fireplace, scattering
ashes and coals all around the lodge, and frightening
the people sitting there. And the Kootenai
questioned it, and it answered that it knew
nothing of the lost horses.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us sing the sacred song again,&rsquo; the
Kootenai called out from his dark little lodge,
and the people sang it with him, not once, but
four times. The Kootenai then blew his whistle
four times, four long, loud whistles. At the time
there was no wind, but soon they heard, far off,
the roar of an approaching wind of terrible force.
Said the Kootenai then: &lsquo;I have called him, he
is coming, Old-Man-of-the-Winds: be not afraid;
he will not harm you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came with dreadful whirlwinds of his
making. Winds that shook the lodge, and made
the lodge ears hum with the noise of that of a
hundred swarms of bees. And then, suddenly,
the wind fell, and outside the people heard this
wind god ask: &lsquo;Why have you sung&mdash;why have
you whistled for me&mdash;what is it you want to
know?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Kootenai answered: &lsquo;Mountain Chief,
here, has lost his two best horses. Fast buffalo
runners they are; both black; one with a white
spot on his side. I called you to ask if you have
seen them anywhere?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I have not seen them,&rsquo; Old-Man-of-the-Winds
answered. &lsquo;As you know, I belong on the
west side of this Backbone-of-the-World. It is
from there that I start the winds that blow over
your country. I have been no farther out than
here. No, I have not seen the horses.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now I am depressed,&rsquo; the Kootenai exclaimed.
&lsquo;I did not expect to learn much about
this from the birds, the animals, trees, and rocks,
even the bumblebee could tell me nothing; but
I felt that you would surely know where the
two horses are!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I have a friend who can tell you what
you want to know,&rsquo; said Old-Man-of-the-Winds.
&lsquo;He is Red-Top Plume. He lives in the clouds;
he can see the whole country; undoubtedly he
can tell you where those horses are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is a stranger to me. How shall I find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
him&mdash;this Red-Top Plume?&rsquo; the Kootenai
asked; and all the people held their breath,
waiting to hear the answer. Here was sacred
talk; talk of a man with a god, and about gods:
they could hardly believe that it was real, that
which they were hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answered Old-Man-of-the-Winds: &lsquo;Watch
the clouds. When you see one of them turning
from white to red, as the sun goes down to his
lodge on his island in the great sea, you will
know that Red-Top Plume is there above you.
That red cloud is his plume. Yes, when you see
that, sing your song again four times; blow your
whistle again four times, and he will answer you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And with that the wind suddenly started to
blow from the east, and Old-Man-of-the-Winds
went with it back to his western home, and they
heard him no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From his dark little lodge in the big lodge,
the Kootenai called out to Mountain Chief: &lsquo;Go,
stand outside your lodge, watch for a cloud
turning red, and when you see it, come inside and
tell me that it is there above us.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mountain Chief went outside. He looked up
and saw but a few small, white, slowly drifting
clouds in the sky. There were four of them
straight above him. These drifted toward one
another, and he cried out: &lsquo;A sign! A sacred
sign! Four small clouds are getting together to
make one large cloud!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And at that all the people in the lodge cried
out: &lsquo;The sacred number! Oh, sun! Oh, Above
People all! Pity us! Pity us all! Allow us to
survive all dangers! Give us long life and happiness!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, as the sun was setting, Mountain
Chief cried out: &lsquo;The four are now one large
cloud, and its edge is beginning to turn red! Ai!
The red, the sacred color, spreads over it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His voice trembled. Himself, he trembled;
for he knew that he was looking&mdash;not at an
ordinary cloud, but at Red-Top Plume himself,
the great cloud god!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come in! Come in!&rsquo; the Kootenai cried to
him. And he went back into the lodge and
joined in the singing of the sacred song. Four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
times they sang it, oh, how earnestly! The
Kootenai then blew his wing-bone whistle four
times. Followed a silence; the people scarcely
daring to breathe. And then they heard outside,
in a deep and beautiful voice: &lsquo;I am Red-Top
Plume! Why have you called me here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Red-Top Plume! God of the clouds! Pity
us!&rsquo; the Kootenai answered. &lsquo;It is a matter of
horses; of two fast buffalo runners; both black;
one with a white spot on its side. We have lost
them. Have you&mdash;oh, have you seen them anywhere?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is a small thing to call me down
about,&rsquo; the sky god answered; &lsquo;but, since I am
here, I will tell you what I know: Yes, I have
seen them. I saw them just now as I came down
to earth. They are standing beside the spring
just up the hill from where you camped when
you lost them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! Ah! Ah!&rsquo; the people exclaimed in
hushed voices. And the Kootenai, questioner of
gods and unafraid, cried out: &lsquo;Red-Top Plume!
Sacred plumed god of the clouds! You are good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
to us. Tell us, now, what we can do for you&mdash;what
sacrifice to do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he got no answer. Red-Top Plume had
gone&mdash;gone back to his home in the sky, and
the people, rushing out from the lodge, looked
up and saw him moving slowly eastward, his
beautiful plumes redder than ever. And while
the Kootenai and Mountain Chief and the other
warriors made sacrifice to him, some young men
mounted their horses and rode back to the camping-place
where the two horses had been lost, and
lo! they found them near the spring where Red-Top
Plume had told that they were standing.&rdquo;</p>


<h3><i>July 22.</i></h3>

<p>Even in my day the many beaver dams in this
wide canyon were in good repair, and the ponds
were dotted with inhabited beaver lodges. There
are few of the little woodcutters here now, but in
time to come, under the sure protection of the
supervisor of this Glacier National Park, they
will become as numerous as they were before the
white man came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
Talk about beavers to-night brought out a
most interesting story by Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill.
Said he: &ldquo;Beavers build a great
dam, often working moons and moons to complete
it. Then, when it is finished, and a great
pond created, they build their lodges in the
backed-up water, and cut their winter supply
of cottonwood, willow, and quaking aspen, which
they tow out in convenient lengths and sink in
deep water around the lodges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, after a few winters, they have to move
on and build another dam-and-pond, for they will
have used up all the available trees and willows
around the first pond. But that is still their pond,
the clan that built it, and in time, when a new
growth of food trees has sprung up around it, they
return there, repair the dam, build new lodges,
and remain as long as the young trees last.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>WHITE FUR AND HIS BEAVER CLAN</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Away back in the ancient days, when our
first fathers were able to talk with the animals,
a beaver chief named White Fur, with his family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
and his relatives, built a big dam on this river.
You can still see the remains of it, willow-grown,
and it still backs up some water, a pond as large
in extent as the camp of our tribe. But in the
old days that dam extended from one side to
the other of the valley, and the water it backed
up was more than a pond: it was a small lake.
Above here, there is a swift stream of white
water rushing down the north side of the valley
from great ice banks in the mountains. Well,
just below its junction with the river is where
White Fur built the dam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time passed. The sons of other beaver
clans came and married the daughters of White
Fur&rsquo;s clan, and took them off, and the sons of
his clan went out and found wives and brought
them home. The clan increased; the pond became
full of lodges; the trees were cut in greater
number each succeeding summer. So it was that,
when the ice went out one spring, White Fur
went around and around the pond, examining
the remaining food trees, and saw that there remained
only a few more than enough for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
coming winter. It was no more than he expected;
his last hurried look around, just before the
freeze-up in the fall, had warned him that the
food supply was getting small.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<a name="beaverdam" id="beaverdam"></a>
<img src="images/bt09.jpg" width="468" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE BEAVER DAM</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;He went home, and called a council, told
what he had learned on his round, and then
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We must move out from here as soon as the
ice breaks up next spring, and when we go we
must know just where we are going; we cannot
afford to lose time hunting for a good place to
make a new home. Now, who will start out on
discovery?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will!&rsquo; his eldest son, Loud Slap, first answered.
He was so named because he could
tail-slap the water louder than any one else in
the whole gens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Loud Slap was White Fur&rsquo;s favorite
son, and next to himself the best, the wisest
dam-builder in the gens. The chief wanted to
keep him at home, for going on discovery was
very dangerous. But for very shame he could
not order him to remain and let some other take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
the risk. So, with sinking heart, he said: &lsquo;You
spoke up first, my son, so you shall be the first
one to look for a new home for us. I have had a
dream, and I want you to find out if it told me
truth: Go down this river a little way beyond
the edge of the pines, look north, and you will
see a big ridge with a low gap in it. Go up
through that gap, and down the other side, and
you will soon come to a small branch of a good-sized
stream; look at all the branches of that
stream for a good home for us, and come back
and tell us all about it. Make that crossing
through the gap in the daytime, for then the
most of our enemies, the mountain lion, the
fisher and the wolverine, the wolf and the
coyote, are generally asleep. Night is the time
that they do their murdering work.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As you say, so I will do,&rsquo; Loud Slap answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the next morning, some time before daylight,
he started down river on his dangerous
trail of discovery. Below his pond there were
other ponds; and as he swam through them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
many of the beavers living in them asked him
where he was going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Out on discovery; our food trees will last
us only this coming winter; we have to find a
new home,&rsquo; he answered them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On he went, through the last of the ponds,
down the river, swimming fast, so very fast that
his big webbed hind feet, swiftly kicking, made
the water foam past his breast. He had started
out too early; when he passed the last of the
pines, daylight was still some time off, so he dived
under a pile of driftwood, then crawled up into
it, found a good resting-place on one of the logs
and went to sleep, sure that none of the prowlers
could reach him there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sun shining down through the little
openings in the driftwood pile awakened him.
He slipped down into the water, made a dive,
and came up out in the middle of the river.
Near by was a high, sloping bank bare of trees
and brush; he swam to shore, climbed it, looked
north, and saw the big ridge and the big, low
gap in it. He looked all around; no animals were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
in sight except a few elk, and he knew that they
would not harm him: he began waddling toward
the gap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sun was hot. Loud Slap&rsquo;s legs were
short; his body fat and heavy; there was no
water; he soon became very tired and thirsty,
and the top of the gap seemed to be a long way
off. More and more often he had to stop and
rest, but he kept saying to himself: &lsquo;I will not
give up! I will not give up!&rsquo;&mdash;and at last he
arrived at the top of the gap. Close up to the
top on the other side were thick, cool groves of
quaking aspen and willows; as far as he could
see, the valley below him and its far side was
one green growth of trees, and he knew that
somewhere down there was water, plenty of it.
Down he went, oh, how easily, on the steeper
places just pushing a little with his hind feet and
sliding along on his belly. He soon came to a
small stream of running water and drank and
drank of it, rolled over and over in its shallowness
until wet all over, and then he followed it
down. Other little streams came into it, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
last it became so deep that he could swim. After
a time he came to where this stream joined a
much larger one, and he turned and went up it,
and away up in the timber found where a dam
could be built that would form a very large pond,
and best of all the quaking aspens and willows
were everywhere there growing so closely together
that they formed a food supply that
would last a number of winters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That night Loud Slap slept in a hole that
he dug in a bank of the stream. This is the one
which we long ago named Ki-nuk&prime;-si Is-si-sak&prime;-ta.
I understand that the white people have another
name for it.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
Ki-nuk&prime;-si Is-si-sak&prime;-ta (Little River). By the whites
named Milk River. <a href="#FNanchor_5">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Early next morning Loud Slap came out of
his hole, cut down a small quaking aspen, and
ate all he wanted of its bark. He then swam
down the stream, turned up its little fork, and
before the sun was very high left it and took his
back trail up through the gap, and before noon
was going down the long slope to Cutbank River.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
The going was easy. But one thing troubled him:
the risk that he ran traveling there in that open,
waterless country. Whenever he came to a
patch of buck brush or a clump of tall grass, he
would sit up and look all around to see if any
enemy was near; and then he would go on, keeping
as close to the ground as possible. Twice he
saw a coyote in the distance, and sat motionless
until the animal moved on out of sight. And
then, when almost to the river, sitting up and
looking out from a brush patch, he saw a wolverine
coming straight toward him. He trembled;
he shivered. &lsquo;Now is my end come!&rsquo; he
said to himself, and imagined how it was going
to feel to be bitten and clawed and torn to
death. Because of his helplessness, because he
could in no way defend himself, he wept; but
silently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On came the wolverine, sniffing the ground;
sniffing the rocks; the weed growths; and once,
when he turned and looked back, Loud Slap
threw himself flat there in the brush; he had not
dared move before. The wind was from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
southwest; the wolverine was coming from the
west, and that was one thing in Loud Slap&rsquo;s
favor. But on which side of that patch of brush
would he pass? If to the north, then he would
scent the beaver-odor trail, follow it, and all
would be over. If he passed to the south of the
patch, and not too close, then all would be well.
From where he lay, flat on the ground in the
brush, Loud Slap could see nothing but the brush
stems in front of his nose; but presently he
heard, close to the patch and to the west of it,
the sniff! sniff! sniffle! of his enemy. He closed
his eyes; his body shook with fear; he could almost
feel strong, sharp-fanged jaws closing upon
his neck! The suspense was terribly hard to
bear! And then, after what seemed to be a whole
moon of time, he heard the sniffling close in front
of him; then faint and fainter off in the direction
of the river; and presently he opened his eyes,
little by little rose up, and looked out from his
hiding-place. Lo! Wolverine had come close,
<em>close</em> to the brush patch, and south of it, and
then had turned, and was now walking slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
toward the river! &lsquo;My enemy passes! I survive!&rsquo;
Loud Slap said to himself, and would have sung
had he dared. Oh, yes, beavers sang in those
days, as you shall learn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loud Slap watched the wolverine go on down
the valley, and then waddled to the river as
fast as he could work his legs. How good it felt,
that plunge into the cool water from the bank!
and, once into it, he made it foam as he swam
homeward against the swift current. Long before
night he climbed the dam of the upper pond,
and a little later entered his father&rsquo;s lodge. &lsquo;Ha!
Back so soon! What found you, my son?&rsquo; old
White Fur asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A fine stream there on the other side of the
gap. A place to dam a large pond. Plenty of food
bark trees,&rsquo; Loud Slap answered, and then told
carefully all about the place, and about his narrow
escape from the wolverine. Then his mother
went swimming from lodge to lodge of the gens,
calling all the heads of the families, and when
they had gathered in White Fur&rsquo;s lodge he told
again of his find and of the dangers of the trail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
All went home pleased that he had found such
a good place for a new home for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;White Fur and his whole gens worked very
hard that summer to get in sufficient food bark
sticks for the winter supply. They had to drag
the last of them a long way to water, and they
kept at it long after the snow came, and until
the ice and cold weather prevented further cutting.
The trails they left in the snow, just before
the pond froze over, were a sure call to their
passing enemies, and they halted and lay in
wait beside them, and killed in all five of the
members of the gens, one of them Loud Slap&rsquo;s
oldest son. A lynx was seen to spring upon him
and carry him off, as he was going out to finish
cutting down a large tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The winter passed. When spring came, there
was still considerable food bark untouched on
the underwater piles, but, oh, how glad the
beavers were to be able to swim about again,
and eat fresh bark from living tree branches.
All were anxious to start at once for the new
home across the ridge, but White Fur would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
permit it. From the pressure of the winter
snows the dead grass of the past summer lay
flat: &lsquo;We must wait until the new grass grows
high enough to conceal us,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and then we
will go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, he meant those that would be able
to go: females with newborn young were to remain
where they were until the young should be
old enough to travel, and then they were to
cross the ridge and join their mates. The new
grass came, and when it was a little higher than
the top of a beaver&rsquo;s back, old White Fur and
Loud Slap led all those who could go, about
fifty of them, down the river on the way to the
stream beyond the gap. White Fur had already
talked with the chief who lived in the next pond
below, and he had promised to keep all newcomers
from occupying the pond that White
Fur and his gens were leaving for a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The travelers saw no enemy on the trail up
through the gap, and, upon arriving at the place
that Loud Slap had discovered, were well pleased
with it. That very evening, after a heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
meal of bark, they began work on the dam, and
by morning had much willow brush laid, butts
to the current, across the stream. Night and
day, with little rest, they toiled to complete the
dam, of sticks and stones and sod and earth,
and within two moons&rsquo; time they finished it,
and had a pond large enough and deep enough
for the lodges of the gens, and all the food sticks
they would need to sink for winter use. Then,
one evening, came those who had been left behind,
came with their strong and half-grown
young, and all began at once to cut and bring
in and sink the winter food supply. Long before
winter set in they had stored more than they
could possibly use, and from that time until the
ice formed they did nothing more than strengthen
the dam, and eat and sleep, and play about in
the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The winter passed, and more young were
born. Came and went another winter, and in
the spring more young were born. There were
now in the gens many two, and three, and some
four-year-olds, both male and female, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
could not mate with one another; something had
to be done for them. Old White Fur called a
council, and there was much talk about it. Some
favored sending scouts away down the Little
River to learn if there were any beaver colonies
along it. Others, and the greater number, declared
that the unmarried males should take the
trail through the gap down to Cutbank River,
find mates in the different gens having ponds
along it, and tell the unmarried males there to
come over and take wives from White Fur&rsquo;s
gens. It was decided that this should be done,
and one morning more than forty young males
started for Cutbank River.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Days passed; and yet more days, and no
wife-seeking beavers came to the pond on Little
River. &lsquo;Something is wrong,&rsquo; White Fur told
Loud Slap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Ai!</em> Something is wrong. If none come
within four days&rsquo; time, I shall go over to the
Cutbank ponds and learn what the trouble is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The four days passed, and no stranger, not
one, came. On the fifth morning Loud Slap once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
more took the trail for Cutbank, saying to White
Fur as he left, &lsquo;If I do not return within four
days&rsquo; time, then send some one over to learn
what the trouble is, for I shall be dead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down the river went Loud Slap, and up the
little fork, and thence along the trail through
the gap in the ridge. He moved along very cautiously,
keeping a sharp lookout in all directions,
and seeing nothing to alarm him. After passing
through the gap he saw, on a ridge to the east, a
number of wolves following a small band of
buffalo, and that pleased him, for, seeking food
there, they would not be likely to turn and cross
his trail. He hurried on down the slope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, when near the river, a whirl of
wind brought a dreadful odor to his nostrils; an
odor of dead and decaying flesh. He stopped,
sat up, looked sharply ahead, saw nothing to
alarm him, went on a short distance, and came
upon a scene that made him shiver; that made
him mourn: there, on the trail and on both sides
of it, lay his youthful kin who had gone out to
seek wives! There they lay, their bodies swollen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
and bursting, every one of them mangled and
torn, several half eaten by their enemies, wolves
probably, that had discovered and killed them
all! One look at them was enough; he hurried
on, weeping, and plunged into the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upstream he went, faster than he had ever
swam before, and soon entered the lower one
of the beaver ponds. Straight to the chief&rsquo;s
lodge he swam, and dived down to the entrance,
and went up into the big and comfortable grass-floored
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha! Loud Slap! It is you! Welcome you
are! Sit youth and give us the news!&rsquo; the chief
cried out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loud Slap greeted him and gave the news,
and both wept over the death of so many of their
kind. The chief&rsquo;s wife went out and spread the
news, and there was mourning in every lodge in
that pond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chief then gave Loud Slap bad news.
Said he: &lsquo;In the early part of this moon came
to us a visitor from the big pond at the head of
the lake on the next stream south of this river.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
He meant, of course, the great beaver pond just
above Lower Two Medicine Lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; said Loud Slap,&mdash;&lsquo;yes?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! He came and visited us and our kin
in the other ponds, and gave no reason for his
coming, and soon went home. But in a few
days&rsquo; time he returned with all his gens, and
they are many, and took possession of the upper
pond, your pond, and at this time they are repairing
the dam and backing the water up into
the new growth of food trees, which are as thick
as they can stand. We told him, we all told him,
this chief,&mdash;Strong Dam is his name,&mdash;that he
should not take the pond, as it belongs to you,
to your father, White Fur, and his gens. But
he said that he did not care who owned it, he
had taken it, and would hold it, fight for it
against all comers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha! Is it so!&rsquo; Loud Slap cried. &lsquo;We will
see about that! Say nothing to any one that I
have been here. Tell your people to keep my
visit secret from all above here. I go to bring my
kindred over, and we will drive that Strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
Dam and his gens back whence they came, or
kill them all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loud Slap went back to his Little River
home the next day, and told all that he had seen
and learned. All mourned and mourned for their
dead, and their hearts burned with anger against
Strong Dam and his gens. Said White Fur: &lsquo;I
am old, old. But I can still fight! We will go
over to our pond to-morrow. I will lead you,
and we will teach that Strong Dam and his relatives
something; we will send them crying back
to their pond above the lake!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They started the next morning, all the males,
and even females that were without young; and
they were many, those who were waiting for
males of other gentes to come and marry them.
Old White Fur led them across to the river without
mishap, and up to the first pond, where they
visited, and rested, and ate their fill of fresh,
green bark. And there some of the females met
young unmarried males who wanted to mate
with them; and they answered, &lsquo;We will marry
you, but first you must fight for us; you must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
help us drive that Strong Dam and his gens
from our pond.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And is that all you ask?&rsquo; they replied. &lsquo;We
are only too glad to help you. Who would not
fight for his sweetheart should not have one!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This gave White Fur something to think
about; and after a time he said to Loud Slap:
&lsquo;Go, now, on a secret mission: visit the ponds of
our friends above here, and say to the unmarried
males that our young females here will
marry them, but they must first help us drive
Strong Dam from this river.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ai! That is a good plan,&rsquo; said Loud Slap;
and he started at once to carry it out. Late that
night he returned, and reported that all the young
males had agreed to the proposal, and would join
White Fur and his kin when they came along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us start now,&rsquo; said White Fur; and the
advance began, and by the time he reached the
dam of his own old pond, he had a large following.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a young man lying there on the
dam, a far-back ancestor of ours who had gone
there to get his medicine dream; his vision. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
was awake; and when, in the bright moonlight,
he saw that big, old, white-furred beaver come
up on the dam, and a hundred and more beaver
following, he could not believe his eyes, and
cried out: &lsquo;Am I really and truly awake, or is
this a medicine vision?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hush! Keep still,&rsquo; old White Fur told him.
&lsquo;What you see is real. We are come to fight and
drive off those here who have stolen our pond
and our new growth of food trees. Just you keep
still: we want to surprise them. If you see that
they are beating us, then give us help. When all
is over, I will give you a medicine that will insure
you long life and happiness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young man&mdash;No Otter was his name&mdash;made
signs that he would keep quiet. And he
sat there and watched more than a hundred
beavers cross the dam close in front of him, and
slide quietly into the pond, and even then could
hardly believe that he was not dreaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As they entered the water that great war
party of beavers swam out in all directions for
the shores of the pond, where, scattered all along,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
Strong Dam and his kin were already cutting
the young trees for winter food. And as he
watched and listened, the young man heard
suddenly a great commotion and squealing all
along the shore: the fighting had begun. Then,
almost at once, the attacked and the attackers
took to the water, and the whole surface of the
pond was as if it had been struck by a tornado.
It boiled, and eddied, and foamed, and shot high
in spray, and with it all was the slap! slap! slap!
of beaver tails as the animals struggled and
clinched, and floundered and bit, all over its
long length and width. And soon beavers,
frightened and gasping for breath, and bleeding
from many wounds, began to pass on each side
of the young man over the dam, and drop into
the stream below and disappear in its swift current.
And some, unable to climb it, and bleeding
from many wounds, died there at the edge of the
dam and sank. The water was red with their
blood. One of them, crawling out, staggered
right up against the young man, and gasped, and
died, and he put out his hand and felt of it, its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
wet coat, the warm but now breathless body,
and then for the first time was he sure that what
he was witnessing was real, and no dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fight was over. The last of the enemy
had been killed, or had fled down river, and
White Fur and his party gathered on the dam.
Not all were there: some of them lay dead on
the bottom of the pond or sorely wounded on
the shore. White Fur directed that they should
be helped into the cool lodges, where they would
be safe from the prowlers, and there cared for
and fed. That done, said White Fur to the
young man: &lsquo;You have seen a great sight this
night. Had we needed your help I know that
you would have given it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, you had but to call, and I would have
been with you,&rsquo; the young man answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; said White Fur, &lsquo;and just for
your good-will I shall give you a strong medicine,
and teach you the songs that go with it.
But I cannot do this here; you will have to go
home with us, to our pond on the next stream
to the north.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
&ldquo;They went there the next day, leaving behind
the newly married females and their mates
to care for the wounded and make them well.
And on the way up through the gap and down to
the pond, White Fur and Loud Slap told the
young man the story of their lives and their
troubles, just as I am telling it to you. And
upon reaching the pond on Little River, No
Otter remained there a long time with the beavers,
the old chief and his son, Loud Slap, giving
him a medicine beaver cutting and teaching him
the beaver songs. It was a good medicine. He
took it home with him, and kept it, and made
ceremony with it, and sang the songs as he had
been taught to do, and because of that he had
great success at war, and in curing the sick, and
he lived to great age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kyi! So ends my story.&rdquo;</p>


<h3><i>July 25.</i></h3>

<p>Yesterday Guardipe, or, as I prefer to call
him, A&iacute;-is-an-ah-mak-an (Takes-Gun-Ahead),
climbed with me to the top of White Calf Mountain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
There, on the extreme summit of the
rough crested mountain, we came upon five bighorn,
all ewes, and not one of them with a lamb
beside her. During the lambing season here this
year there was a continuous downpour of rain
and sleet and snow, in which the newborn young
undoubtedly perished.</p>

<p>But how tame those five ewes were! We
walked to within fifty yards of them, and they
gazed at us curiously, now and then nervously
stamping the rock with one or the other of their
fore feet. And then they circled around us,
twice, and finally walked off toward the eastern
point of the mountain, often stopping to look
back at us, and finally disappeared behind some
rock piles.</p>

<p>At the same time Kut&prime;-ai-ko-pak-i (No-Coward-Woman&mdash;as
my people have named my
wife) was having her own experience with the
game in this Park. With Miss L&mdash;&mdash;, a Boston
friend, she was sitting near the edge of a high,
almost cutbank at the edge of the river, when she
heard the slow, heavy, twig-snapping tread of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
animal back in the brush. She gave her friend a
nudge, and pointed in the direction of the sounds,
and the two watched and listened. And presently
they saw the brush shaking as the animal forced
its way through it, and then, half revealed and
half concealed in more open brush, they saw a
big grizzly coming straight toward them! Right
near where they sat a dwarf juniper grew at the
edge of the high bank, several of its limbs overhanging
it. Without speaking a word, and
trembling as though they had ague, they crept
to the tree, grasped one of the limbs, and tenaciously
gripping it let themselves down over the
edge of the bank. And then&mdash;the limb broke
with a loud snap and down they went along the
gravelly incline, so steep that they could get no
foothold, over and over, head first, feet first, and
sideways, and landed in the river with a loud
splash. But they did not mind that: what were
bruises and a wetting compared to being mauled
by a grizzly? They forded the waist-deep stream
and arrived dripping but safe in camp, and were
glad to be there!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
Although this Glacier National Park is only
five years old, the game animals within it have
already become very tame. The bighorn and the
Rocky Mountain goats no longer flee from parties
traversing the mountain trails, and the deer and
elk and moose have become almost as fearless as
they are. As for the bears, they are continually
trying to break into the meat-houses of the different
camps. Undoubtedly these mountains
and forests within the next ten years will fairly
be alive with game. And as to trout, the supply
is increasing instead of decreasing. In this Cutbank
stream alone there have been caught this
season in the neighborhood of two thousand
trout, weighing from a fourth of a pound up to
four pounds, but since the 1st of April seventy
thousand young trout, from the Anaconda hatchery,
have been put into it.</p>

<h3><i>July 27.</i></h3>

<p>Last night, in Black Bull&rsquo;s lodge, we had more
tales of the long ago in this Cutbank Valley.
Would that I had the time to collect all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
Blackfeet legends of the various places in their
once enormous domain. From the Saskatchewan
to the Yellowstone, and from the Rockies between
these two streams, eastward for about
three hundred miles, there are tales of adventure,
of camp-life, and wonderful legends, for every
mountain, stream, butte, and spring within that
great area. Said Black Bull last night:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you a story that my grandfather
told me. It happened in the days of his fathers&rsquo;
boyhood, and it is called</p>


<h4>&ldquo;THE STORY OF THE BAD WIFE</h4>

<p>&ldquo;One summer in that time the people, having
made new lodges, moved up here on Cutbank
River to cut new lodge poles, and to gather
weasel-eyes,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which grew in great quantities back
on the high mountain slopes.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
Ap-ah a-wap-spi. Weasel-eyes: huckleberries. <a href="#FNanchor_6">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;At that time one of the best-liked young men
of the tribe was Falling Bear. He was a very
brave and successful warrior, and very kind-hearted:
he took it upon himself to keep three or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
four old widows and several old and helpless men
supplied with all the meat and skins they could
use, and even gave them gentle horses for packing
and riding whenever camp was moved. At
the time the people moved up here on Cutbank,
he had been married but a short time. He had
fallen in love with Otter Woman, the most beautiful
girl in the tribe, and with her father&rsquo;s and
mother&rsquo;s consent, and to their great joy and
pride, had set up with her a lodge of his own.
No word had been so much as whispered against
Otter Woman; she was believed to be as good
and pure as she was beautiful of face and
form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tribe had not been here many days when
Falling Bear decided to go to war. Many of the
warriors, some of them much older than he,
wanted to go with him, but he told them all that
this time, because of a dream, a vision he had,
he would take no one but his woman. He made
full preparation for the war trail, had a sacred
sweat with an old medicine man, who was to
pray for him during his absence, and then, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
his woman, he took the Cutbank trail for the
country of the West Side tribes, all of them
enemies of the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Traveling with great caution, and only at
night, he passed through the country of the
Flatheads, and came to the plains country of the
Nez Perc&eacute;s. There he struck the trail of a big
hunting party of people, and followed it, and
soon found that he was gaining upon them; one
early morning he came upon their camping-place
which they must have left on the previous afternoon,
for in some of the fireplaces there were still
live coals deep down in the ashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, on the night before he had lost his
tobacco, and his desire to smoke was strong
within him. So he said to his woman, &lsquo;You go
around on that side of the big camping-place and
examine every lodge site for tobacco leavings,
and I will search this side for it.&rsquo; They parted
and began their quest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The camp had been pitched partly in an
open, grassy park, and partly in the timber surrounding
it; and because of that Falling Bear and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
his woman were often out of sight of each other.
At one of these times Otter Woman was examining
a lodge site and fireplace back in the timber,
and, happening to look off to one side, she saw
hanging on some brush a fine shield, some beautiful
war clothes, and a large fringed and painted
medicine pouch. She well knew that these had
been spread out to sun by the campers and forgotten,
and that some one would be coming back
for them, and was about to go after Falling Bear
to come and take them when she heard the
tread of an approaching horse. So near was it
that she had not time to run and hide. She stood
still, staring, and almost at once there came in
sight, on a black-and-white pinto horse, the
handsomest young man that she had ever seen.
He was so handsome that to look at him gave
her a yearning pain in the heart for him. Just
one look, and she had fallen in love with him!
She didn&rsquo;t want to fall in love with him; she
just couldn&rsquo;t help it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;He, this Nez Perc&eacute;, checked up his horse and
sat quiet, staring down at her, and no doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
thought her the handsomest woman he had ever
seen. Suddenly she began making signs to him.
What a wonderful thing that silent language is!
All the tribes of the plains know it. Just by the
use of their hands they can express their every
thought to one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signed she: &lsquo;My man is over there! Be quiet.
I will go to him, somehow get his weapons from
him, then hold him. You come quickly when I
cry out, and kill him, and I will go with you; will
be your woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, nothing could have pleased the
Nez Perc&eacute; more than that. To kill an enemy
and take his beautiful woman, what a big <i>coup</i>
that would be! He signed to the woman that
what she proposed was good, and slid from his
horse and tied it to a tree, then signed to her to
go, and he would follow, keeping out of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman crossed the big camping-ground
and found her man: &lsquo;I have made a great find,&rsquo;
she told him. &lsquo;On some bushes over there are
hanging beautiful war clothes, a shield, weapons,
and a medicine pouch. Leave you your weapons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
and things here, and come with me, and take
them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But why should I leave my weapons? One
should never be without them,&rsquo; he objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because from here goes the trail we are to
follow, and you will have all you can do to bring
here what I have found,&rsquo; she explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t see any sense in leaving his weapons,
but took her word and laid them down,
along with his medicine pouch, and his war
clothes in their <i>parfl&egrave;che</i> (painted cylinder), and
followed her out into the open park. &lsquo;The things
are right across there in the brush,&rsquo; she told
him, pointing to the place, and then gradually
dropped back to his side, and then a step behind
him. Then, as they came near the brush on the
far side, she suddenly seized him, endeavoring
to squeeze his arms close to his side, so that he
could not use them, and at the same time she
called out to the Nez Perc&eacute; to come to her assistance.
He had been watching, and was already
coming as fast as he could run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Falling Bear, of course, saw at once the intentions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
of the two, and as quick as a flash of lightning
made up his mind what to do. He only half
struggled with the woman, now grasping his neck
with one hand and arm, and beating his eyes
and face with the other hand. She was fast
blinding him, but he stood the pain of it until the
Nez Perc&eacute;, with war club raised, was but a step
or two away. He then broke loose from the
woman, kicked backward, his foot striking her
in the stomach and knocking her over, and then
he sprang at the Nez Perc&eacute;, seized the arm and
hand that held the war club high, and struggled
with the man for possession of it. He wrenched
it away from him, and with it struck him a hard
blow on the head, and he fell, his skull crushed
in, and died. The victor scalped him with his
own knife, took his war club and his bow and
arrows, and then turned to the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She lay where she had fallen, trembling at
what she had done, wishing that she had not
done it. &lsquo;Get up. If you spoke truth, if there
are war clothes and other things over there, lead
me to them,&rsquo; Falling Bear told her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
&ldquo;She arose, still trembling, but now with some
hope that he was not going to kill her, and led
him to the place. His eyes were swelling shut so
fast that one was entirely closed, but he could
partly use the other. He looked at the things
there on the brush: &lsquo;Ah! Here are the war
clothes, the shield, the medicine pouch, but
where are the weapons?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman did not answer. What could she
say? There had been no weapons left on the
brush. Falling Bear laughed a laugh that made
her shiver, and told her to gather up all that was
there and follow him. He unfastened the horse
and led it across the camping-place, she following,
and he had her take up his own weapons and
things and fasten them to the saddle. He then
mounted the horse, and told her to lead it and
take the back trail home. Before he had ridden
far his other eye closed; he was, for the time,
wholly blind; but not afraid. He kept close possession
of all the weapons, and made the woman
do everything that he wanted done. She minded
his every word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
&ldquo;Traveling again at night, and hiding in the
brush during the daytime, the two passed safely
through the country of the Flatheads, and
crossed the mountains. On the morning that
they approached the camp here on Cutbank,
Falling Bear had partly recovered the use of one
eye. The other was still swollen shut; it seemed
to have been poisoned by the woman&rsquo;s fingernails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When so near the camp that they could
plainly see the lodges, Falling Bear told the
woman to go on in and tell her relatives to come
to him; that he would await them right where he
was. They soon came out to him, his father-in-law
and his brother-in-law, and when they saw
his scarred face and swollen eyes, they cried out:
&lsquo;Oh, what has happened to you? Have you been
in a fight with a mountain lion?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Worse than that,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;this was
done to me by the one I most loved and trusted.&rsquo;
And then he told them all about it, and concluded
by giving them the horse and all the
things that he had taken from the Nez Perc&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
&ldquo;When he finished his awful tale the two
men, listening closely, were so overcome with
shame and grief that for a time they could not
speak. But at last Falling Bear&rsquo;s father-in-law
said: &lsquo;I have made up my mind what to do.
Come! Let us go on into camp.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They went in; Falling Bear to his own lodge&mdash;in
which his father and mother lived. His
woman was not there; she had gone to her
father&rsquo;s lodge. He was glad that she had gone
there; he never wanted to see her again. His
father asked him to give the story of his war
trail, and he answered that he had nothing to
say. He was so sick at heart that he could not
talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrived in his own lodge, and finding his
daughter, Otter Woman, there, Falling Bear&rsquo;s
father-in-law told her to go out for a time; and
when she was gone he told her mother all that
she had done, and then, calling in their son, the
three agreed upon the way the bad wife should
be punished. They called her in and told her to
braid her hair nicely, and to put on her best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
clothes. And while she was doing that, her
father and mother and brother painted their
faces black and let down their hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as Otter Woman was dressed, her
father said to her: &lsquo;We will now go outside, and
you will mount the Nez Perc&eacute; horse. I will lead
it, your mother and brother will follow, and we
will go all through the camp, stopping here and
there to tell the people all about the great wrong
you did your man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, no, no! Not that!&rsquo; Otter Woman cried.
&lsquo;I am ashamed enough as it is! I am sorry that
I did it! I don&rsquo;t know how I came to do it; I
shall never, never do such a thing again!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You spoke the truth there,&rsquo; said her father.
&lsquo;No, you will never do it again!&rsquo; And he ordered
her to go out ahead of them and mount the horse.
She did so and sat upon it, head cast down,
looking neither to the right nor left nor ahead:
shame was with her. Holding the horse&rsquo;s rope,
the old man shouted: &lsquo;Listen, people, listen.&rsquo;
And when a crowd had gathered he told them
what his daughter had done to her good man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
and the people groaned with shame that one of
their tribe could be so bad of heart. Some even
wept at the horror of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From one part of the camp to another the
old man led the little procession, stopping often
to tell the shameful story, until all knew it.
And then at last he led the horse out into the
center of the great circle of the lodges, and told
his daughter to dismount. She did so, and,
drawing his knife, he stabbed her in the heart
and she fell and died. Said he then to his wife:
&lsquo;Get women to help you; drag that body far off
and leave it, and never let me hear again the
name of her who was once my daughter!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the women did as he said. Never again did
any one mention Otter Woman in his presence.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="break">&ldquo;Ai! A sad story! A story to give one bad
dreams! Let us have one of more cheerful nature
before we go to bed,&rdquo; said Stabs-by-Mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Old Man story, then,&rdquo; said Two Guns.
&ldquo;All are laughable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elder brother, tell us the story of Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
Man and the woman,&rdquo; said Black Bull to Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ai! That I will,&rdquo; the chief answered.</p>

<p>But before I set down the story, I must explain
Old Man.</p>

<p>Old Man (N&auml;p&prime;-i) was the god who created
the world, and all life upon it, and he was <em>the</em> god
of the Blackfeet until, some centuries back, they
got from some southern tribe another religion, of
which the sun is the principal god. However,
they still pray to Old Man, as well as to the gods
of the later religion, although in time a great
many stories have grown up about Old Man
that make him appear to be more of a buffoon
than a god. An interesting point about the word
<i>n&auml;p&prime;-i</i> is, that, while it is the term for an old man,
its real meaning is dawn, or the first faint, white
light that gives birth to the day. And so, in
common with the ancient Mexicans, various
tribes of the plains, the Aryans and other ancient
races of the Old World, the original religion of
the Blackfeet was the worship of light personified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
Let us have now, the old chief&rsquo;s story of</p>


<h4>OLD MAN AND THE WOMAN</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Having created the world, the animals, grass,
trees, all life upon it, Old Man realized that by
having men live by themselves, and women by
themselves, he had made a mistake. He saw that
they should live together. The camps of the two
sexes were far apart: the women were living here
at the foot of the mountains, in Cutbank Valley,
and the men were away down on Two Medicine
River. Each camp had a buffalo trap, and subsisted
wholly upon the buffalo that were decoyed
into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I have said, Old Man saw that he had
made a mistake in keeping men and women
apart. In fact, he found that he himself
wanted a woman; so he went to the men and
said: &lsquo;You shall no longer live by yourselves.
Come! We will go up to the camp of the women,
and each of us get one of them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men were more than glad to do that; it
was what they had been hoping to do for a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
time; so they hurried to put on their best clothes,
and neatly braided their hair, and then started
off with Old Man for the women&rsquo;s camp. When
they came in sight of it, Old Man told them to
stop right there, and he would go ahead and
plan with the women just what should be done.
They sat down, and he went on to the women&rsquo;s
camp. Himself, he had on his old, soiled clothes;
his fine clothes he had left back with the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrived in the camp, he found only two or
three women there; the woman chief and all the
others were down at the buffalo trap, butchering
the animals that they had that morning decoyed
into it. When he told the few women that he
found why he had come, he greatly excited and
pleased them, and they started at once to run
and tell the others to hurry up from the trap
and meet the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But wait. Not so fast. I want a word with
you,&rsquo; Old Man called out; and when they came
back to him, he asked: &lsquo;What kind of a woman
is your chief?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Everything that is good, and kind and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
brave, that is our chief,&rsquo; one answered. And
another said: &lsquo;Ai! She is all that, and more;
and she is the most beautiful woman of us all!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This pleased Old Man. He said to himself,
&lsquo;That is the woman for me. I must have her.&rsquo;
And to the waiting women he said: &lsquo;It is right
that chief woman should mate with chief man.
You women are to come to us, and each select
the man you want. Now, tell your chief woman
that the chief man is brave and kind and handsome,
and that she shall select him for her man.
She will know him by the way he is dressed.
He wears buckskin shirt and leggings, embroidered
with porcupine quills, and a cow-leather
robe with a big porcupine-quill embroidered sun
in the center of it. You tell her to take him for
her man!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We will do so!&rsquo; the women cried, and
started off for the buffalo trap as fast as they
could run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Man hurried back to the waiting men,
and hurriedly put on his fine clothes, the ones
that he had described to the women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
&ldquo;Trembling with excitement, and out of
breath from their long, swift run, Old Man&rsquo;s
messengers arrived at the buffalo trap and told
their wonderful news,&mdash;that men had come to
marry them; that each woman was to choose the
man that she thought would best suit her. The
butchering of the animals ceased at once, and
the women started for their camp to put on
their good clothes and recomb their hair. They
wanted to appear as neat and clean and well
dressed as possible, before the men. Yes, all ran
for their camp, all except the chief woman.
Said she: &lsquo;I cannot leave here until I finish
skinning this spotted medicine calf. Go, all of
you, and I will join you as soon as I can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The work took more time than she thought
would be required, and when she arrived in
camp with the valuable skin, she found all the
other women dressed and impatient to go and
choose their men. &lsquo;Oh, well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter
how I look,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I am chief; I have a name;
I can go choose my man dressed just as I am.
How did you say the man chief is dressed?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
&ldquo;They told her again what he wore, according
to what the messenger man had told them, and
she said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll choose him. Chief, I suppose, must
mate with chief.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so she went right on with the others,
wearing her butchering dress, all stiff with blood
and grease from the neck down to the bottom
of the skirt; and her moccasins were even more
foul than the skirt. Her hands were caked with
dried blood, and her hair was not even braided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their chief leading, the women approached
the waiting men, all of them standing in a line,
and singing a song of greeting. Old Man stood
at the head of the line, very straight and proud,
and of fine appearance in his beautiful new porcupine-embroidered
clothes. By these the chief
woman recognized him from afar, and said to
herself: &lsquo;He is a fine looking man. I hope that
he will prove to be as good of heart as he is good
to look at.&rsquo; And, leading her women, she walked
straight up to him and laid a hand on his arm:
&lsquo;I will take you for my man,&rsquo; she told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Old Man shrank back, his face plainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
showing his loathing of such a bloody and greasy,
wild-haired woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I take you for my man,&rsquo; the woman chief
repeated; and then he broke away from her hold
and ran behind his men: &lsquo;No! No! I do not want
you, bloody, greasy woman,&rsquo; he cried, and went
still farther off behind his men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman chief turned to her followers:
&lsquo;Go back! Go back to that little hill and there
wait for me,&rsquo; she told them. And to the men she
said, &lsquo;Remain where you are until I return. I
shall not be gone long.&rsquo; And with that she turned
and hurried to her camp. Her women went to
the hill. The men remained where they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down at her camp the chief woman took off
her old clothes and bathed in the river. Then
she put on her fine clothes, a pair of new moccasins,
braided her hair, scented herself with
sweetgrass, and returned to her women. She
was now better dressed than any of them, and
they had told Old Man the truth when they
said that she was beautiful of face and form:
she was the most beautiful woman of them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
&ldquo;Again she led her women to the line of waiting
men. Again Old Man stood first, stood at
the head of them. But she passed him by, as
though she did not see him, and he, with a little
cry, ran after her, took her by the arm, and
said: &lsquo;You are the woman for me. I am the
chief of the men: you must take me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She turned upon him, and her eyes were like
fire. She tore his hand from her arm, and cried:
&lsquo;Never touch me again, good-for-nothing, proud-and-useless
man. I would die before I would
mate with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to her women she said: &lsquo;Do not, any of
you, take him for your man.&rsquo; And with that she
turned and chose a man. The others then, one
by one, took their choice of the men. When all
had chosen, there was one woman who had no
man; all had been taken except Old Man. She
would not have him, and became the second wife
of one of the men. The choosing over, all started
for the women&rsquo;s camp. Old Man, now very sad-hearted,
was for following them; but the chief
woman turned and motioned him off. &lsquo;Go away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
There is no food for you, no place for you in our
camp,&rsquo; she told him; and he went away, crying,
by himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is what Old Man got for being so
proud.&rdquo;</p>


<h3><i>July 30.</i></h3>

<p>We break camp and move northward to-morrow.
For the past two days some of us have
been riding about on this &ldquo;Backbone-of-the-World,&rdquo;
as the Blackfeet call the Rocky Mountains,
and we have ridden our horses where, in
former times, nothing but a bird could go. The
Park Supervisor and his engineers and miners
and sappers have blasted out trails over the highest
parts of the range, making it easy and safe for
tenderfeet tourists to view the wonders of this
sub-Arctic, greater than Alpine range of mountains.
One of the most impressive views is from
the summit of the trail from Upper Two Medicine
Lake to Cutbank River. The Dry Fork
Trail, it is called. At its extreme height the trail
is along a mountain crest about thirty feet in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
width. Mr. L.&nbsp;W. Hill graphically described
the stretch the other day, when, after crossing
it, he said: &ldquo;On its east side one can spit straight
down three thousand feet into a lake, and on
the other side cast a stone that will go down
much farther than that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, the view of the mountains and cliffs
and canyons from that height is so grand, so
stupendous and impressive, that one cannot find
words to describe it all.</p>

<p>On another day we went over Cutbank Pass
and down the west side of the range, far enough
to get a good view of the Pumpelly Glacier, and
see the huge ice blocks break from it and drop
from a cliff more than two thousand feet in
height. They strike the bottom of the canyon
with a reverberating crash that can be heard
for miles. Just below this glacier, down Nyack
Creek three or four miles, is a fine alkaline
spring and clay bed where, in other days, old
Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill and I were
wont to go for bighorn, goats, deer, and elk. All
these animals came to it in great numbers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
drank the waters, and ate great wads of the salty
mud. We once killed a large grizzly there, whose
late autumn coat was as black as that of a black
bear.</p>

<div class="caption">STABS-BY-MISTAKE, SUN WOMAN, AND HER SON, LITTLE OTTER
IN CUTBANK CA&Ntilde;ON</div>
</div>

<p>This afternoon we have had further talk about
the naming of these mountains. For a wonder,
the topographers have not taken away the original
name for the outer mountain on the north
side of this Cutbank Valley: we find on the
map that it is still White Calf Mountain. It was
named for one of the greatest chiefs the Montana
Blackfeet ever had. As a young man, fresh from
his first war trail, he witnessed the signing of the
treaty between his people and the representatives
of the United States, at the mouth of the
Judith River, in 1855, so he must have been
born in 1836 or 1837. As a warrior, his rise to
fame was rapid, and many are the stories told
of his indomitable bravery in facing the enemy.
In later years, because of his great interest in
the welfare of his people, he became their head
chief. He died in Washington, in 1903, while
there on tribal business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
The right names of the other mountains walling
in this valley are as follows: The unnamed
mountain next west from White Calf Mountain
is Ahk&prime;-sap-ah-ki (Generous Woman); Mount
James is Ah&prime;-kow-to-mak-an (Double Runner);
Mount Vorhis is O-nis-tai&prime;-na (Wonderful Chief).
The west one of the Twin Buttes is Little Plume;
the east one is O-nis-tai&prime;-mak-an (Wonderful
Runner). And, as I have said, the outer mountain
on the south side of the valley is Muk-sin-a&prime;
(Angry Woman). All but the last one were
named for old-time great chiefs and warriors of
my people, and we intend that they shall be so
named on the official maps, even if we have to
petition the House of Representatives and the
Senate, in Washington, to make the change!
And you, my readers, lovers of these grandest
mountains of our country, will you not be with
us in this perfectly proper request?</p>

<p>Said Takes-Gun-Ahead to me this afternoon:
&ldquo;Who are these white men, James, and Vorhis,
for whom the mountains were named? Were
they great warriors, or presidents, or wise men?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
I had to confess that I had never heard of
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he exclaimed. And &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; all the
others, even the women, echoed.</p>

OF A TANNED ELK-SKIN</div>
</div>

<p>Yesterday Takes-Gun-Ahead and I oiled our
rifles and started out after meat. We went up
the river, passing the old beaver dams that
White Fur and Loud Slap built in the long ago,
and presently, in the dense growth of pine, cottonwood,
and willow, came upon old and fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
tracks of deer and elk. We followed for a time
the trail of four or five elk, and left it to take
the very fresh trail of a moose. Takes-Gun-Ahead
was in the lead, and within ten minutes
he saw the animal not fifty yards away, standing
partly concealed behind a clump of willows and
watching our approach. Its head was in plain
view, and he fired and struck it just at the base
of the ear, and it fell, gave a convulsive kick or
two, and was dead when we got to it. It was a
three-year-old bull, and carried a very ordinary
set of antlers, velvet-covered and still soft at the
points. I dressed the carcass while my companion
went back for a horse, and before noon we
had real meat&mdash;<i>ni-tap&prime;-i-wak-sin</i>&mdash;in camp. We
distributed it among the lodges, and there was
great rejoicing. Later in the day, Two Guns
and Black Bull brought in a fine buck mule
deer, and at sunset Big Spring returned with the
meat and skin of a yearling ram that he had
killed on the outer point of Divide Mountain.
It was like old times,&mdash;the camp red with meat,&mdash;and
we all felt rich and happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
The killing of the moose in this particular
place brought out a lot of reminiscences of happenings
here on Little River in other days,
and of them all I think that Takes-Gun-Ahead&rsquo;s
story was the best. As the pipe went the first
round after our feast of roast moose ribs in
Black Bull&rsquo;s lodge, said he: &ldquo;I will tell you the
story of</p>


<h4>&ldquo;OLD MAN AND THE WOLVES</h4>

<p>&ldquo;One day in that long ago time, Old Man was
wandering along the edge of this forest, having
come over from Cutbank way. He was feeling
very lonely, and wondering what he could do to
have a more lively time, when, as he approached
the river here, probably right where we are
camped, he saw a band of six wolves sitting on
the bank, watching him. He stopped short,
watched them for a time, and then approached
them, whining out: &lsquo;My younger brothers! My
younger brothers! I am very lonely! Take pity
on me: let me be a wolf with you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I have said, the wolves were six: the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
father and mother, their two daughters, and
their sons, Heavy Body and Long Body. The
old father wolf answered Old Man. &lsquo;Just what
do you mean?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Is it that you want me
to change you into a wolf&mdash;that you want to
live just as we do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to live with you, hunt with you,&rsquo; he
answered, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t want to be changed
wholly into a wolf. Just make my head and neck
to look like yours, and put wolf hair on my
legs and arms, and that will be about enough
of a change. I will keep my body just as it is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well, we will do that for you,&rsquo; said
the old wolf; and he took a gray medicine and
rubbed it on Old Man&rsquo;s head and neck and legs
and arms, and made the change. &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said
he. &lsquo;My work is done. I would like to have made
you all wolf, your body as well as the rest of you,
but you will do as you are; you are quite wolf-like.
And now, let me tell you something about
our family. My old wife and I don&rsquo;t hunt much.
Your two younger brothers there are the runners
and killers, and their sisters help in the way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
heading off and confusing the game. Your
younger brother there, Long Body, is the swiftest
runner, but he hasn&rsquo;t the best of wind. However,
he generally overtakes and kills whatever
he chases. Your other younger brother, Heavy
Body, is not a fast runner, but he has great staying
power, never gets winded, and in the end
brings down his game. And now you know
them. Whenever you feel like hunting, one or
the other of them, as you choose, will go with
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are very kind to me,&rsquo; said Old Man.
&lsquo;I am now very tired, but to-morrow I shall want
to hunt with one or the other of them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We are also tired; we have come a long way;
it is best that we all rest during this night,&rsquo; said
the old wolf; and he led the way up to the top
of a high ridge on the north side of the valley,
where all lay down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But why rest out on top of this barren,
windy place, instead of in the shelter of the timber?&rsquo;
Old Man asked, his teeth beginning to
chatter from the cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;We never rest in the timber,&rsquo; the old wolf
replied. &lsquo;There enemies would have a good
chance to take us unawares. Here we can see
afar everything that moves, and as one or another
of us is always on watch, we can keep out
of danger. Also, we can look down and see the
different kinds of game, and make our plans to
chase what we want, head it off, tire it out, and
kill it. We always, summer and winter, do our
resting and sleeping on high places.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before the night was far gone, Old Man became
so cold that he trembled all over, and, try
as he would, he could not keep his jaws together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You annoy us with your tremblings, and
your teeth chatterings; you keep us from sleeping,&rsquo;
the old wolf complained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I shall not annoy you long,&rsquo; Old Man
answered, &lsquo;because I shall soon freeze to death!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old wolf aroused his wife and children:
&lsquo;This tender-bodied elder brother of ours is
freezing. I suppose we have to protect him.
Lie down in a circle around him and cover him
with your tails,&rsquo; he told them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
&ldquo;They did so, and he was soon overcome
with heat: &lsquo;Take your ill-smelling tails from my
body; I am wet with perspiration!&rsquo; he gasped.
They removed their tails and he soon began to
shiver. &lsquo;Put them back! I freeze!&rsquo; he cried; and
they did as he commanded. During the night he
had them cover him many times with their tails,
and as many times remove them. He passed a
miserable night, and so did the wolves, for he
kept them from sleeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At break of day all arose, and, looking down
into the valley, saw a lone, buck mule deer feeding
farther and farther away from the timber.
They made a plan for capturing it. They all
sneaked around into the timber, and then Long
Body and Old Man crept down the valley until
the buck saw them and ran, and then they
chased it. Long Body soon pulled it down, and
Old Man came up in time to seize and break its
neck, and felt very proud of himself. The other
wolves soon came to the kill, and all feasted.
The carcass lasted them two days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again and again they went to the top of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
ridge to pass the night, and Old Man soon became
so used to the cold that he did not need
tail covering. When the deer was eaten, they
killed another one, and then a buffalo bull,
which lasted them some days. Then, after two
failures in chasing antelope and some hungry
days, Long Body killed a big bull elk, just outside
the timber here. They were several days
eating it, but at last all the meat and the soft
bones were finished, and nothing but the backbone
and the hard leg bones remained. Said the
old wolf then: &lsquo;We must be saving of what we
have left, for it may be some time before we can
make another killing. To-day we will take turns
chewing the upper bone of a hind leg.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They gathered in a small circle with one of
the bones, noses to the center, and the old wolf
said to Old Man: &lsquo;Now, while this chewing is
going on, bone splinters are bound to fly. You
must keep your eyes tight shut until it comes
your turn to chew, else you may get a splinter
that will blind you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Man did as he was told. The old wolf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
began the chewing, and after gnawing off the
end of the bone, and getting a little of the marrow,
called out to his wife that it was her turn
to chew and passed her the bone. And so from
one to another it went around the circle until
Long Body got it, and Old Man&rsquo;s turn came
next. His curiosity now got the better of him:
he just had to see what was going on, and slowly
opened one eye, the one next to Long Body.
All the wolves had their heads to the ground or
resting on their fore paws, and all&mdash;even Long
Body, busily chewing the bone&mdash;kept their eyes
tight shut. &lsquo;Huh! This is a queer way to feast,&rsquo;
Old Man said to himself, and just then a splinter
flew from the bone and struck his open eye, not
putting it out, but causing him great pain and
making him very angry. &lsquo;I will pay him for
that!&rsquo; he thought, and waited his turn at the bone,
becoming more and more angry as he waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your turn, Old Man,&rsquo; said Long Body after
a time, and passed him the bone. Old Man
took it, chewed it for a time, looking sharply at
all the wolves. All had their eyes tight shut, so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
raising the bone as high as he could, he brought
it down with all the force of his arm upon Long
Body&rsquo;s head and killed him. The other wolves,
hearing his twitching, as he died, opened their
eyes, saw him dead, and Old Man staring in
horror at what he had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, what have you done! You have killed
your younger brother!&rsquo; the old wolf cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rsquo; Old Man answered.
&lsquo;When he was chewing the bone he let a splinter
fly, and it struck me in this eye. I meant to
punish him a little for being so careless, but I
did not mean to kill him. I must have struck
harder than I thought to do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You had your eyes open! It was your fault
that you got the splinter!&rsquo; the old wolf said;
and then he and all the rest began grieving for
their dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the rest of that day, and all through the
night, they howled and howled, and Old Man
thought that he would go mad from the mournfulness
of it all. He was very sorry&mdash;he hated
himself for what he had done in his anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
&ldquo;The mourning-time over, the wolves dug a
hole in the ground and buried Long Body, and
then scolded Old Man. &lsquo;Had you killed my son
intentionally,&rsquo; the old wolf concluded, &lsquo;we would
have had your life in payment for his life. As it
is, we will give you one more trial: see that such
an accident as that never again occurs!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Younger brother,&rsquo; said Old Man, &lsquo;I am
grieving and very restless because of what I have
done. I want to be moving; to be doing something.
Let Heavy Body go with me up in this
pine forest, and we will try to kill something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old wolf remained silent for some time,
thinking, and at last answered: &lsquo;Yes, I will
allow him to go with you, and remember this:
if anything happens to him, we shall hold you
responsible, and great will be your punishment!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two started off, and Old Man said to
his partner, &lsquo;In some ways I am wiser than
you. I have this to say, and you must heed it:
Whatever you start after, be it deer or elk or
moose, and no matter how close you may get to
it, if it crosses a stream, even a little stream
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
that you can jump, stop right there and turn
back. Mind, now, even if a few more leaps will
get you to the animal&rsquo;s throat, you are not to
make those leaps if it crosses a stream. Should
you keep on, death in some form will get you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How do you know this?&rsquo; Heavy Body
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I may not tell you all that I know,&rsquo; Old
Man replied. &lsquo;I have given you the warning;
heed it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They went farther up in the timber, and
after some nosing of trails started a big bull
moose, and took after it, Heavy Body running
far in the lead. He was fast gaining upon it, was
almost at its heels, when it jumped into a wide,
long pond, really a widening of the creek, and
started swimming across it to an island, and
from that to the other shore. Heavy Body
thought of Old Man&rsquo;s warning, but said to himself:
&lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know everything. I must have
that moose!&rsquo; And into the water he went and
started swimming toward the island. And just
as he was nearing it a water bear sprang from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
the shore, and killed him, and dragged him to
land, and Old Man appeared at the edge of the
pond just in time to see the bear and her two
nearly grown young begin feasting upon her kill.
With a heart full of rage and sorrow, he turned
back into the timber and considered how he
could revenge the death of Heavy Body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two mornings later, just before daylight,
Old Man came again to the shore of the pond,
and close to the edge of the water took his stand
and gave himself the appearance of an old stump.
Soon after sunrise the old water bear, coming
out from the brush on the island, saw it, sat up
and stared at it, and said to herself: &lsquo;I do not remember
having seen that stump before. I suspicion
that it is Old Man, come to do me harm.
I saw him right there when I killed the wolf.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She stared and stared at the stump, and at
last called out her young, and said to one of
them: &lsquo;Go across there and bite, and claw that
stump. I believe that it is Old Man. If it is, he
will cry out and run when you hurt him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young bear swam across and went up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
to the stump, and bit, and clawed it, and hurt
Old Man. He was almost on the point of giving
up and running away, when it left him and went
back to the island and told the old one that the
stump was a stump, and nothing else. But the
old one was not satisfied. She sent the other
young one over, and it bit and clawed Old Man
harder than its brother had, but he stood the
pain, bad as it was, and that young one went
back and also said that the stump was just
a common old stump and without life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the old water bear was not yet satisfied.
She went across herself, and bit and tore at
the stump with her claws, and what Old Man
had suffered from the others was nothing compared
to what he endured from her attack. He
stood it, however, and at last, satisfied that her
children had been right, that this was a stump
and nothing else, she left it and started back for
the island. Then it was that, just as she was
entering the water, Old Man picked up the bow
and arrows he had made during the two days
back in the timber and shot an arrow into her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
well back in the loin; but she dove under water
so quickly that he could not see whether he had
hit her or not. She swam under water clear
around back of the island, and went ashore
where he could not see her. He turned, then, and
went away back in the timber, and slept all the
rest of the day and all of the following night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Early the next morning he was approaching
the pond by way of the stream running from it,
when he saw a kingfisher sitting on a limb of a
tree overhanging the water, and looking intently
down into it: &lsquo;Little brother, what do you
there?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The old water bear has been shot,&rsquo; the bird
answered. &lsquo;She bathes in the water, and clots of
blood and pieces of fat escape from the wound,
and when they come floating along here I seize
them, and eat them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha! So I did hit her!&rsquo; Old Man said. &lsquo;How
badly, I wonder?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went on up the shore of the stream,
trying to think of some way to get complete
revenge for the death of Heavy Body, when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
heard some one out in the brush chanting:
&lsquo;Some one has shot the old water bear! I have
to doctor the old water bear! Some one has shot
the old water bear! I have to doctor the old
water bear!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went out to see who this might be, and
found that it was the bull frog, jumping about
and making the chant after every jump. He
went to him and asked if the bear was much
hurt?</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is an arrow in her loin,&rsquo; the frog answered,
&lsquo;and as soon as I find a certain medicine
plant, I shall pull the arrow out and apply the
crushed plant to the wound. I believe that I can
save her life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That you never will,&rsquo; Old Man said, and
fired an arrow into him, and killed him. He then
took his skin, put it on, tore up a handful of a
green plant, and swam to the island. As soon as
he reached the shore he began chanting as the
frog had done: &lsquo;Some one has shot the old water
bear! I have to doctor the old water bear!&rsquo; And
so, chanting and jumping, he followed a trail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
into the brush and came upon the old bear and
her two young. She was lying on her side, breathing
heavily, and her eyes were shut. Old Man
bent over her, and, firmly grasping the arrow,
shoved it in until it pierced her heart, and she
gave a kick and died! He then picked up a club
and killed the two young. &lsquo;There! That ends
the water bear family. I was crazy ever to have
made her and her husband!&rsquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Casting off the frog skin now, he with great
difficulty floated the three bears from the island
to the shore of the pond. There, a short distance
back from it, he found a bowl-shaped depression
in the ground. Into this he dragged the carcasses
of the bears, after skinning them and taking off
all the fat from their meat and insides, and then
he tried out the fat and poured the oil over them,
completely covering them and filling the depression.
He then called the animals. &lsquo;All you who
would be fat, come bathe in this oil,&rsquo; he shouted.
And on all sides the animals heard and began to
come in. The bears&mdash;real bears, the grizzly
and the black&mdash;came first and rolled in the oil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
and ever since that time they have been the
fattest of all animals. Then came the skunk; next
the badger; after him the porcupine, and rolled
in the oil and got fat. The beaver came and
swam across the oil. All that part of him above
the water as he swam&mdash;his head and the forward
part of his back&mdash;got no fat, but all the rest
of his body&mdash;his sides, belly, and tail&mdash;became
extremely fat. Last of all the animals came the
rabbit. He did not go into the oil, but, dipping a
paw into it, rubbed it upon his back between his
shoulders and upon the inside of each leg. That
is why he has no fat on other parts of his body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, there!&rsquo; Old Man exclaimed, after the
rabbit had gone. &lsquo;I have done some good. I
have avenged the death of my wolf partner and
have made fat many of my younger brothers!&rsquo;
And with that he started off seeking more adventures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kyi! My story ends.&rdquo;</p>


<h3><i>August 4.</i></h3>

<p>Not for many years, I am sure, have my relatives
and friends here been so happy as they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
just now. Instead of beef or no meat of any kind,
as is generally the case with them when at home,&mdash;some
die every winter from want of food,&mdash;they
have now in every lodge real meat; meat of
moose and elk and bighorn, and so are living
much as they did in the days before the white
men overran their country and killed off their
game.</p>

<p>A happy heart sharpens one&rsquo;s wits. All day
yesterday, as I knew, my two old relatives, Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill
and Yellow Wolf,
were considering what other one of the tribal
stories about the Little River country would
most please me. I had told them that I could
not put them all down&mdash;could use only two or
three of the most interesting ones. And so, when
we all gathered in Yellow Wolf&rsquo;s lodge last
evening, and the pipe was lighted and started
on the round of our circle, he said that it had
been decided that I should have the story
of the rescue of a boy from the Crows, and
that he would tell it. It was called, he said, the
story of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span></p>

<h4>&ldquo;NEW ROBE, THE RESCUER</h4>

<p>&ldquo;In the long ago, before our forefathers had
taken this country from the Crows, they were
one summer camping and hunting on the Big
River of the North.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Came the evening of a
long, hot day, and a boy of eight or nine winters&mdash;Lone
Star was his name&mdash;failed to return to
his parents&rsquo; lodge. The chiefs ordered the camp
crier out, and he went all among the lodges,
shouting the news, and asking if any one had
seen the boy? None had; so then the chiefs
ordered all the men and youths to go out and
try to find him. All that moonlit night, and all
the next day, they searched the surrounding
country, but got no trace of him. Every alighting
buzzard was marked down, but in every
instance it was found to be feasting upon the
remains of game that the hunters had killed. So
then, although his body could not be found, most
of the people believed that the boy was dead.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
His beautiful sister, Red Cloud Woman, and his
father, Black Bear, thought otherwise; they believed
that he had been stolen by the enemy,
and publicly, all through the camp, the two
went, the girl vowing that she would marry
whoever would find her brother, the old man
adding that she had his permission to make the
vow.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>&ldquo;There was in the camp a very poor young
man, named New Robe. So poor was he that he
had never owned a new robe, nor a new shirt,
nor leggins, nor even new moccasins. His father
and mother were dead, and always, as far back
as he could remember, he had worn nothing but
the used clothes the charitable had given him.
He had never been to war, had never done anything
to make a name for himself, but now he
was eager to start in quest of the missing boy.
He had long loved the girl, but had never even
spoken to her. He now went to her and said:
&lsquo;Tell no one about it. Just silently pray for me.
I am going to travel far in search of your
brother.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
&ldquo;Said the girl: &lsquo;This is not a time for me to
hide my heart from you. I have watched you,
loved you for a very long time. But what could
I say? Nothing. Well I knew that my people
would not allow me to marry one so poor as you.
But now there is hope for us; somehow I believe
that this trouble is to be the means of bringing
us together.&rsquo; And with that she kissed him, and
he went quietly out from camp, unobserved by
any one, and started southward on his quest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many days later, in the valley of Old Man&rsquo;s
River, New Robe came upon an old camp-ground
of the enemy&mdash;Crows, of course, for
that was then their country. From it he found
that they had moved south, and he followed their
trail, ever along the foot of the mountains, and
knew that he was fast overtaking them. At the
River-of-Many-Chiefs-Gathering<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> he found live
coals in the ashes of their abandoned fireplaces,
and so, upon arriving at the top of the ridge
overlooking this stream, he was not surprised to
see the lodges of the great Crow camp here&mdash;right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
here where we are encamped to-night.
They were set up in a great circle, and in the
center of it was a huge lodge covered with old
lodge skins: the Crows were having their medicine
lodge ceremonies!</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as night came and before the moon
arose, New Robe descended the hill and entered
the camp. The people were all of them gathered
at the medicine lodge, singing and dancing, and
fulfilling their vows to the sun, so he went from
one living lodge to another, looking into each for
some sign of the missing boy. By the time he
had made the round of the lodges of half of the
circle it was midnight, and the people were beginning
to go home to sleep. He left the camp
and went back on the ridge, having found no
trace of the one for whom he searched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next night New Robe descended the
ridge and searched the lodges of the other half
of the circle, and found not what he sought.
When he had finished, the people were still
gathered at the medicine lodge, and, desperate,
and knowing well the great risk that he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
incur, he went toward it, and stood at the outer
edge of the great crowd and watched the ceremonial
dancing of the different warrior clans.
He kept his face partly concealed with his old
robe, and moved from place to place around the
outer circle of the people, and none observed
him, so intent were they upon watching the
dancers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last, during a quiet interval between
dances, he imagined that he heard some one
groaning, but, look where he would, he could see
no one in distress, nor could he locate the exact
place from which the groaning came. It was a
light-voiced groaning, such as a child would
make; he felt sure that it came from little Lone
Star, somewhere in that great lodge, and in great
pain. He left the place, went outside the circle
of lodges, and lay down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was long past midnight when the people
returned to their lodges. Then, as soon as the
camp became quiet, New Robe returned to the
medicine lodge, and, listening, heard faint groaning
and located it. It came from the top of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
center post, where all the sacrifices to the sun
were hung. He was sure then that it was no
other than Lone Star up there, lashed to the
post, a living sacrifice to the sun, and there to
die!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well he knew that there, within the lodge,
were sleeping the women who had vowed to build
the great structure in honor of the sun. And
there, too, in his secret, walled-off little inner
lodge, slept the medicine man whose duty it was
to drive back approaching thunderclouds and
rain. He had to risk awakening them! He had
at least to attempt to rescue the boy! So, casting
off his robe, he climbed the outer wall of the
lodge, and from it crawled along one of the big
long poles that slanted up to the center post.
There he found Lone Star, firmly lashed to one
of its forks, and so far gone that he could no
longer even groan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silently, very carefully, New Robe unwound
the lashing, and then, fastening an end of it under
the boy&rsquo;s arms, let him down to the ground.
He then descended, and found that the boy was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
so numb that he could not walk. There was but
one thing to do then. He took the helpless one
upon his back, stole out of the lodge, and started
with him across the big camp-ground. Dawn
had come. As he was passing the circle of lodges,
an early riser, a woman, saw him and with her
shrieks aroused all the near-by sleepers. They
rushed out, warriors and youths, the women following,
and overtook him. He made no resistance.
He could have left the boy and made his
own escape, but he would not do that. Several
old warriors seized him and the boy, and hurried
them to the lodge of the head chief, the
women and the youths following and crying out
that they be killed. Inside the lodge, the chief
motioned them to seats, and in signs asked New
Robe what he had to say for himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I came not to harm you,&rsquo; New Robe answered,
&lsquo;nor to take from you anything that is
yours. I came to find this boy, and take him
back to his mourning father and mother and sister.
And where did I find him! Tied to the center
post of your medicine lodge, there to die from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
want of water and food, a living but dying sacrifice
to the sun! That were too cruel a thing to
do. I ask you not to put him back there. If he is
to die, I die with him. Shoot us, stab us, kill us in
any way you choose, so that our death be quick!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chief gave him no answer to that. He
counseled with the other chiefs for a long time,
and at last signed to him: &lsquo;You are so brave
that we shall give you and the boy a chance for
your lives. You are to remain here in this lodge
to-day, to-night, to-morrow, and the following
night. My young men will keep watch on you,
so do not attempt to escape. On the morning
following your second night here, you are to be
given your chance to leave us unharmed. I shall
not now tell you what that chance will be.&rsquo; And
then, turning to his men, he gave them certain
orders, and they hurried from the lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the two days and two nights, New
Robe prayed as he never had before, prayed for
strength and courage to succeed in whatever he
should be told to do. The people of the lodge
treated him and the boy well. They did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
want for food, nor anything else that would
make for their comfort. Early in the morning
after the second night, the chief signed to him:
&lsquo;It is not my fault, nor the fault of my under
chiefs, that you have to undergo this trial for
your life and that of the boy this day. My
people were crying for your lives; they wanted to
drag you two out from here and fill your bodies
with arrows. I did not want them to do that; my
council of chiefs did not want it done; so we counseled
together and hit upon a way to give you
a chance for your lives. It is not an easy thing
that you have to attempt, but I hope you will
succeed. And, whatever happens, believe this:
I have done the best for you that I could!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little later, soon after the morning meal,
the chief signed the two captives to follow him,
and led them to the medicine lodge. In front of
it were seven fresh buffalo bull heads which a
number of men were skinning, and out in front
of them, in a great half-circle, were gathered
every man, woman, and child of the Mountain
Crow tribe. New Robe wondered what was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
be done with the seven buffalo heads; he suspected
that they were to be in some way used in
his trial for life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; the chief signed, and led him and
the boy to the entrance of the medicine lodge.
There they stood, the mark of many flashing,
angry eyes, and presently the skinners finished
their work, and an old chief placed the shining
skulls in a line out from the doorway of the lodge,
each one of them a long step distant from another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again the head chief made signs to New
Robe: &lsquo;There is your trial for life,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You
are to take the boy on your back, and step from
one to the other of those skulls until you step
upon the last one; pass from it to the ground. If
you succeed in doing that, you and the boy are
free to go to your home, and none of my people
shall harm you on your way. But should you
slip from a skull, and even so much as touch
the ground with your toe, to save your balance,
then the warriors standing out there will fall
upon you, and kill you both.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
&ldquo;New Robe looked long at the seven skulls,
considering what he should do. Being freshly
skinned, he knew that they were very slippery.
And then, which would be safest, to step slowly,
carefully, from one to another, or make a run
across them touching each one quickly, lightly?
They were far apart; too far for slow, deliberate
stepping; he concluded that the thing to do was
to start running from the back of the lodge, and
go along the line of them as fast as he could with
his burden. He signed to the chief that he would
do that, and led the boy to the back of the
lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While going there another thought came to
him. He got back of the boy, and stooped, and
while pretending to fix the young one&rsquo;s belt
and leggins, kept spitting in two places upon
the ground. He then stepped squarely in each
pool of the spit and then upon soft ground, and
coated his moccasin soles with the sandy earth.
Then, suddenly swinging the boy to his back,
and running swiftly across the lodge, he lit upon
the first skull with his right foot, and went leaping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
on from one to another as fast as he could with
the weight upon his back. The third skull began
to turn with him, and he made a weak leap from
it, barely alighting upon the next. But it held
firm and he made a sure leap from it to the next,
and from that to the next, and then, stepping
squarely upon the seventh, and last skull, passed
from it to the ground, and released the boy
from his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crowd stood silent, sullen, watching him.
The head chief came to his side and spoke to
them, and they suddenly broke out in loud
cheers. The chief then signed to New Robe:
&lsquo;There is one thing more you are asked to do
before we send you home. You do not have to
do it, but we hope that you will. Come with me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They went to the lodge of a young chief, and
when they were seated, the chief signed to New
Robe: &lsquo;My father, once a great chief, is an old
man. He does not want to die of old age and long
and painful illness, and he wants a chance to kill
one more enemy before he dies. He wants to fight
you. If he kills you, then that will be good. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
you kill him, then you shall have his war horse
and all his weapons, and I will give you a fine
present, and you and the boy shall go to your
home in perfect safety. Now, what say you to
that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have no weapons,&rsquo; New Robe objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Weapons you shall have,&rsquo; the other replied.
&lsquo;All the warriors of the camp are anxious to loan
you what they have. You shall go with me and
examine what they have until you find just what
you want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;New Robe considered the matter. If he won
out, what honor, what a <i>coup</i> it would be to
return to his people with the weapons and the
war horse of his enemy. If he lost, if he was
killed&mdash;a sudden doubt struck him, and he
asked: &lsquo;If I fall, what will become of the boy?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We promise you now,&rsquo; the chiefs both answered,
&lsquo;that in that case some of us will take the
boy to within sight of the camp of your people,
and send him safely to it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I take your word for that, and now give
me weapons,&rsquo; said New Robe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
&ldquo;He was offered his choice of many bows and
spears, war clubs and knives, but took only a
short, lithe bow and a handful of well-feathered
arrows. Then, standing within the circle of the
lodges, he awaited the coming of the old chief.
He soon appeared, wearing a beautiful war costume
and riding a sorrel pinto war horse. And
now, dressed as he was, and easily controlling
his fiery-tempered mount, he did not seem to be
so very old; at a distance one would have thought
him a young warrior. His weapon in hand was a
long, scalp-tufted spear. On his back he carried
a bow and otter-skin quiver of arrows, and in his
belt, in a handsome sheath, quill-embroidered,
was his knife. Said New Robe to himself: &lsquo;He
looks strong, he is brave. Well, I too must be
brave, and watchful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forth and back across the other side of the
big circle rode the old man, singing a war song,
brandishing his spear, keeping his prancing war
horse well in hand. And then, suddenly urging
him forward, he came swift as the wind at New
Robe. And he, dropping his tattered wrap,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
awaited his coming with ready bow. On he came,
shouting his war cry, and when quite close New
Robe let fly his long and heavy-shafted arrow.
It struck the old warrior fair in the ribs. He
flinched, the mounting blood choked off his war
cry, but on he came, and with a last great effort
hurled his spear, and fell from his horse and died,&mdash;died
without knowing that the weapon had
passed high over New Robe&rsquo;s head!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then what a shout went up from all the
people! Shouts of honor for the old chief who
had preferred death in battle instead of in his
lodge, and shouts too for the young man who had
so bravely faced him. New Robe knew not what
to do. He stood looking this way, that way,
uncertainly. Then came to him the son of the
old dead chief and signed to him to take the horse
and the weapons of his enemy, and he did so.
Then the young man brought to him another
horse, a big and gentle black: &lsquo;I said that I would
give you something,&rsquo; he signed, &lsquo;and here it is.
The boy can ride it home. You may go now,
both of you, and go without fear of pursuit: not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
a man in this camp shall follow you!&rsquo; And without
wasting any time the two mounted the horses
and rode northward away from the camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Blackfeet camp Lone Star&rsquo;s father and
mother grieved more and more for the loss of him,
but his sister, Red Cloud Woman, would not
believe that he was dead; had somehow faith
that he was alive; that New Robe would find
him, and bring him safely home. And at last,
when she saw that her father and mother were
likely to go mad from grief, she told them that
New Robe had gone in search of the boy, and that
she would marry him, even if he returned alone.
Morning after morning she went up on a butte
close to camp and watched the great plain
stretching away to the south, and all day long,
and often on her couch at night, prayed for the
safe return of brother and lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, at last, after many, many days of
worried watching, she saw two riders coming
from the south across the plain, and, sure that
they were those she had been praying for, ran
to meet them. They were the missing ones. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
sprang from their fine horses, and she kissed
first her brother and then clung to New Robe:
&lsquo;I am right now your woman,&rsquo; she cried, and
kissed him again. &lsquo;And I am proud to be your
woman,&rsquo; she went on, &lsquo;so take me up behind you
and we will all ride home!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She got up behind him on his prancing war
horse, and as they rode in he quickly told her of
his adventures, and how, at last, he had fought
and killed the old war chief, and for that had
been given the two horses and all the weapons
and fine war clothes she saw. So it was that,
coming into camp, she had the tale of his brave
deeds to shout to the people, and they, gathering
close around, honored his name and gave him
a chief&rsquo;s greeting. Yes, the poor orphan had
within the length of one moon become a chief,
and had made a mourning father and mother
happy. That very night he and Red Cloud
Woman were given a lodge of their own, and their
happiness was complete.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>IV<br />
<span class="smcap">Puht-o-muk-si-kim-iks (The Lakes Inside):
St. Mary&rsquo;s Lakes</span></h2>


<h3><i>August 10.</i></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E left Little River on the 5th,
crossed the big ridge dividing the
Arctic and the Atlantic waters, and
made camp here on the big prairie at the foot of
the Upper St. Mary&rsquo;s Lake.</p>

<p>In the old days this great valley, hemmed in
by gigantic mountains, was my favorite hunting
ground after the buffalo were exterminated and
there was no more sport to be had upon the
plains.</p>

<div class="caption">CAMP NEAR LOWER END OF UPPER ST. MARY&rsquo;S LAKE</div>
</div>

<p>Hugh Monroe, or Rising Wolf, was, of course,
the first white man to see these most beautiful of
all our Northern Rockies lakes; with the Piegan
Blackfeet he camped at them in 1816, and long
afterward, with his growing family of hardy sons
and daughters, this became his favorite hunting
and trapping ground. When, in the 1830&rsquo;s, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
valiant and much beloved missionary, Father
De Smet, S.J., was visiting the various tribes of
this Northwest country, Monroe was engaged to
take him to a conference with the North Blackfeet,
then camping on the Saskatchewan River.
<i>En route</i> they camped at the foot of the lower of
these lakes, and there erected a large wooden
cross, and named the two sheets of water, St.
Mary&rsquo;s Lakes. Later on, the Stevens expedition
named them Chief Mountain Lakes, but that
name did not last. Monroe and his brother
trappers were all Catholics, and they continued
to use the name that the great priest had given
them, and on the maps they are St. Mary&rsquo;s
Lakes to-day.</p>

<p>During my long friendship with him, Monroe
told me many stories of his adventures here
in early days. This was his favorite mountain
resort on account of the great numbers of moose
that inhabited the heavily timbered valley and
mountain slopes, and of the great variety and
numbers of fur animals that were found here.
The valley swarmed with elk and deer; there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
were countless flocks of bighorn and goats on
the mountains, and herds of buffalo everywhere
along the lower lake, and below it; but Monroe
liked best of all the flesh of moose, and killed
large numbers of them every season that he
camped here.</p>

<p>His method of catching wolves was simple
and unique. He would build an oblong, pyramidal
log pen about eight by sixteen feet at the
base, and eight feet in height, the last layer of
logs being placed about eighteen inches apart.
Easily climbing the slope of this, the wolves would
jump down through the narrow aperture at the
top to feed upon the quantities of meat that had
been placed inside to decoy them, but they could
not jump out. Often, of a morning, the trapper
and his sons would find ten or more big wolves
imprisoned in the trap, and, powder and ball
being very costly, they would kill them with bow
and arrows, skin them, and drag the carcasses
to the river and cast them into it, then take the
hides home and peg them on the ground to dry.
In this manner they would often, in the spring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
have several hundred wolf pelts to pack in to
Fort Benton for sale, and prime pelts sold at
five dollars each, in trade. Their catch of beaver,
otter, mink, martin, and fisher was also large.</p>

<p>Monroe always camped at the foot of the lower
lake, near the outlet, and was there more than
once attacked by roving war parties of Assiniboines,
Crows, and even the Yanktonais. The
horses were kept at night in a strong corral just
back of the lodge, and in the daytime were
watched by some member of the family while
they grazed on the rich prairie grasses. All the
family&mdash;John and Fran&ccedil;ois, the sons, Millie and
Lizzie, the daughters&mdash;and even the mother
had guns, flintlocks, and a good supply of powder
and ball. Early one morning a large war party
was discovered approaching the camp, sneaking
from bush to bush, some crawling on all fours
through the high grass. Lizzie opened fire upon
them and killed her man, and then the fire became
general on both sides. But the Monroes,
in their trenches surrounding the lodge, had the
best of it from the start, and eventually made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
the enemy retreat with a loss of five of their
number. Late the following night the Assiniboines
crept in to make another attack, but the
Monroes were expecting them, waiting for them,
and in the bright moonlight could take fairly
accurate aim. They again drove them off, with a
loss of two more of their number, and that time
they kept going. Nothing more was seen of them.
But for some days the Monroes did not venture
far from their camp.</p>

<p>I first saw the St. Mary&rsquo;s Lakes in October,
1882, in company with Charles Phemmister,
James Rutherford, Charles Carter, and Oliver
Sanderville, all old plainsmen, good company,
and best of hunters. We outfitted for the trip
at the Old Agency, on Badger Creek, Blackfeet
Reservation, and started northward. There was
no trail after leaving the crossing of Little or
Milk River, and we struck up country toward
the big gap in the mountains, in which we knew
the lakes must lie, and that evening camped on
the shore of a large prairie lake that was black
with ducks. I shot a dozen or more of them as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
they flew over a long point, and to my surprise
and delight found that they were all canvasbacks
and redheads, and very fat from feeding upon
the wild celery beds of the lake. I named the
sheet of water Duck Lake.</p>

<p>The next day we made a trail down the long
hill, and camped at the foot of the lower lake,
close to the outlet. Then began two weeks of
most glorious sport. We shot elk, deer, and
several grizzlies in the valley, and bighorn on
a mountain that I named Flat Top, and combed
that mountain from one end to another and on
all sides for an animal known to us as the Rocky
Mountain ibex. We had seen several skins of
them, bought from the Stony Indians by Captain
John Healy, of Fort Whoopup and Fort Benton
fame, but none of us nor any man of our acquaintance&mdash;and
we knew every trapper and trader
in the country&mdash;had ever seen one of the animals
alive. Of course we found none, as this sub-Arctic
animal, which we later learned is a true
antelope, and not an ibex or goat, seldom leaves
the high cliff mountains for the outer and lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
ones of the range. When, later, we did find them,
we in our ignorance named them Rocky Mountain
goats, and that is the common name for
them to-day, despite the fact that they are antelopes.</p>

<p>On this first visit to the St. Mary&rsquo;s Lakes
country I was so impressed by the grandeur of
its mountains, the beauty of its many lakes, and
its plenitude of game, that thereafter for many
years it was, more than anywhere else, my home.
In 1883 I brought out to the lakes a good boat
that I had had built for me at Fort Conrad, and
with it learned that both lakes were alive with
whitefish and Mackinaw, Dolly Varden, and
cutthroat trout. During the summer of this
year I named Red Eagle Mountain and Red
Eagle Lake, after my uncle-in-law, Red Eagle,
owner of the Thunder medicine pipe, and one of
the most high-minded, gentle-hearted Indians
that I ever knew. In the autumn of this year
Dr. George Bird Grinnell joined me, and we
hunted around the lower lake, and went up Swift
Current far enough to see what we thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
would possibly prove to be a glacier. We had not
then time to learn if our surmise was correct.
During our hunt Dr. Grinnell killed a large ram
at long range, offhand, with one shot from his
old Sharp&rsquo;s rifle, on the mountain next above
Flat Top, and I therefore named it Single-Shot
Mountain.</p>

<div class="caption">AT THE NARROWS. UPPER ST. MARY&rsquo;S LAKE</div>
</div>

<p>In the summer of this year I also named Divide
Mountain, because it is the outermost mountain
on the Atlantic-Arctic watershed. At the same
time I named Kootenai Mountain, also for a
very good reason. Some members of that tribe
were encamped beside me at the foot of the upper
lake. I noticed often that they would ride out of
camp at daylight and return at noon or a little
later with all the bighorn or goat meat that their
horses could carry, and finally I asked them where
they went to make their killings so quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me to-morrow and I will show
you something,&rdquo; one of them answered. And the
next morning I rode with him up Red Eagle
Valley and part way up a mountain, where we
tied our horses and went on afoot for a couple of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
hundred yards. Then, looking down into a
<i>coul&eacute;e</i>, we saw a dozen or more bighorn in the
bottom of it and killed four of them. They had
been eating salty clay and drinking from a salt
spring that oozes from the ground there, so I
named the place Kootenai Lick, and also gave
the mountain the name Kootenai. Thereafter
I knew where to go for bighorn when I wanted
one.</p>

<p>In 1884 I named Almost-a-Dog Mountain,
after one of the few survivors of the Baker
massacre, which took place on the Marias River,
January 1, 1870. At that time Colonel E.&nbsp;M.
Baker, with a couple of companies of cavalry
from Fort Shaw, Montana, was trying to find
the camp of Owl Child, a Piegan Blackfoot, and
murderer of a settler named Malcolm Clark, and
arrest him. By mistake he struck the camp of
Heavy Runner and his band of friendly Indians,
and, although the chief came running toward
him waving his letters of recommendation and
his Washington medals, Baker ordered his men
to begin firing, and a terrible massacre ensued,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
the Indians firing not one shot in defense, as
about all the able-bodied men were at the time
on a buffalo hunt. When the firing was over,
two hundred and seventeen old men and women
and children lay dead and dying in their lodges
and in the camp. The soldiers then shot the
wounded, collected the lodges and property of
the Indians in great piles, and set fire to them
and departed.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

The above is an extract from an affidavit by the late
Joseph Kipp, who was Baker&rsquo;s scout and guide at the time. <a href="#FNanchor_9">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1885 Dr. Grinnell, J.&nbsp;B.
Monroe, and I made a trip up Swift Current
River, and discovered and roughly measured the
big glacier at the head of its middle fork, Dr.
Grinnell killing a big ram on the ice while we
were traversing it and avoiding its deep crevasses.
That evening Monroe and I named the glacier
in honor of Dr. Grinnell, and also named the
mountain to the north of it after him. On the
following day we were joined by Lieutenant&mdash;now
Major&mdash;J.&nbsp;H. Beacom, Third Infantry,
and he gave my Indian name, Apikuni, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
high mountain between Swift Current and the
South Fork of Kennedy Creek. Upon our return
to Upper St. Mary&rsquo;s Lake, Dr. Grinnell named
Little Chief Mountain, Monroe gave Citadel
Mountain its name, and I named Yellow Fish,
Goat, Going-to-the-Sun, and Four Bears Mountains.
Yellow Fish (O-to-ko&prime;-mi) was an Indian
who often hunted with us, and Four Bears (Nis-su&prime;-kyai-yo)
was the Blackfeet camp crier, and
a most amusing man.</p>

<p>It was in 1886, I believe, that we three, and my
old-time friend, William Jackson, one-time scout
for General Custer and General Miles, cut a trail
to the head of the St. Mary&rsquo;s Valley and discovered
the great sheet of ice which we named the
Blackfeet Glacier. We at the same time named
Gun-Sight Pass, and named the peak just west
of the glacier, Mount Jackson. It should be
Sik-si-kai&prime;-kwan (Blackfeet Man), Jackson&rsquo;s Indian
name. He was a grandson of Hugh Monroe,
a real plainsman, and one of the bravest men I
ever knew.</p>

<p>Going-to-the-Sun has been climbed this day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
and a flag has been planted upon its summit,
by Paul E. Walker, Esq., of Topeka, Kansas.
Owing to a high cliff upon its upper shoulder,
the mountain has always been considered unclimbable.
But after long search, and with no
little risk, Mr. Walker finally worked out a
way up the wall, and out upon the extreme
crest, and was undoubtedly the first man, white
or red, ever to stand there. He reports that a
magnificent view of the mountains and plains
is to be had from the great height.</p>


<h3><i>August 12.</i></h3>

<p>We have more real meat in camp. Yesterday
Black Bull went up under the north point of
Flat Top Mountain, which is on the Indian Reservation,
and killed two fat young rams. I went
fishing, and in the first pool of the river below the
upper lake, caught several two-&nbsp;and three-pound
cutthroat trout. We had a great feast in the
evening&mdash;roast bighorn ribs, broiled trout, a
quantity of blueberries, and so on.</p>

<p>After the feast was over came story-telling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
time, and we heard this man&rsquo;s and that man&rsquo;s
experiences in hunting in this vicinity in other
days, Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill relating
a hard experience that befell him when once
wintering here with me. He was chasing a
wounded elk on the slope of Single-Shot Mountain,
and stepped upon a sharp, snow-covered
knot that pierced his foot through and through,
and kept him laid up for two months. Yellow
Wolf then related an old-time tale, which incidentally
gave the reason for naming these two
sheets of water the Inside Lakes. He called it,
he said,&mdash;</p>


<h4>&ldquo;THE STORY OF THE FIRST HORSES</h4>

<p>&ldquo;In that long-ago time when the people had
only their great, wolf-like dogs for carrying their
belongings, there were two very poor orphans, a
brother and sister, in the camp. The boy was
very deaf, and because he seemed not to understand
what was shouted at him, he was believed
to be crazy, and not even the relatives of his dead
father and mother cared to have him in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
lodges. One would keep him for a time and tell
him to go, and then another relative would take
him in for a short time, and, getting tired of him,
send him on to another lodge. And wherever he
went, his beautiful young sister went with him.
Often, in good weather, when camp was moved,
the two would stay at the old camp-ground, living
on cast-away meat so long as it lasted, and
then they would overtake the camp and go into
the nearest lodge, and at least be sure of a meal.
They were generally barefooted and always
shabbily dressed. It was a hard life that they led.
And because he was so deaf, and believed to be
crazy, the boy had not even one playmate in all
the camp, nor had his sister, for she knew that
it was her duty to be always at his side. There
came a time, however, when a childless woman,
wife of a great and rich chief, wanted the girl
to raise as her own daughter, and after many
days the boy persuaded her to be adopted, and
he was left alone and more lonely than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not long after this separation, the camp
moved one day, and the boy, Long Arrow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
remained at the old camp-ground to live there as
long as he could on the leavings of the people.
At last he finished the last scrap of thrown
away or forgotten meat and started to overtake
the camp. The day was hot, terribly hot, but
despite that the boy traveled as fast as he could,
often running, and perspiration streamed from
his body and his breath came short and fast in
loud wheezes. Suddenly, while running, he felt
something give way with a snap in his left ear, felt
something moving out from it, and reaching up
he pulled from it a long, round, waxy object that
looked like a worm. He held it in his hand and
ran on, and noted that with the left ear he could
plainly hear his footsteps upon the trail. A little
later something snapped in his right ear, and
began to move out of it, and he took from it
another worm-like substance, and keeping both
in his hand, ran on. He could now hear plainly
with both ears, and so happy was he that he felt
almost as though he could fly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that was not all the good that was to
come to him that day. Early in the morning a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
hunter had left camp with his pack dogs, and
had taken the back trail in search of buffalo,
and just before the boy appeared he had killed
one, and was butchering it when he saw the boy
approaching him. This hunter, Heavy Runner,
was a chief, and one of the kindest men in the
whole camp. He had long thought to do something
for this boy, and now, when he saw him
coming, he said to himself: &lsquo;The time has come.
I shall do something for him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy came to him and his kill, and he
shouted to him, at the same time making signs:
&lsquo;Sit you down, my boy, and rest. You are wet
with sweat, and covered with dust. You must
be very tired. Take this piece of tripe and eat it.
And now let me tell you something: from this
day you are to be my boy. I adopt you. You
shall have a place in my lodge; good clothes; a
good bed. Try to be good, and deserve it all. I
am going to try to make a man of you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Heavy Runner, your kind words make me
want to cry,&rsquo; said the boy, his voice trembling,
tears dropping from his eyes. He swallowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
painfully, brushed away the tears, sat up straight,
and went on: &lsquo;I shall be glad to be your son. I
will do all that I can to deserve what you give
me. And now, let me tell you something. As I
was running away back there on the trail, and
breathing hard, first in one ear, and then in the
other, something broke with a snapping noise
and out came these two worm-like things, and
at once hearing came to me. I believe that I
could hear a mouse walking if he were away
out there beyond your kill.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, that is good news, and a good sign!&rsquo;
Heavy Runner shouted. He was not yet used
to the fact that the boy could hear. Then, remembering,
he said more gently: &lsquo;You take a
good rest while I finish butchering this animal
and packing the dogs, and then we will each take
what meat we can carry and go home. Yes,
boy, you have a home now, and a good one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That evening, when Heavy Runner told his
woman that he had adopted Long Arrow, she
made a great outcry: &lsquo;How could you, and without
asking me, adopt that deaf, crazy boy?&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
she asked. And then, she cried, and said that
she would not have him for a son, and ran from
the lodge. People gathered around and pitied her
and said that she was right; that the boy was
crazy and deaf and worthless, and would not
mind, and as soon as he got good clothes he
would run off and again live at old campgrounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a time she went back to her lodge, and
as soon as she entered it Heavy Runner said
to her: &lsquo;Now, at once, cease your crying, and
take the anger from your heart. I have adopted
this boy, and he is my boy. He is no longer deaf;
he was never crazy. He is a good boy and I shall
make a man, a chief of him. See that you treat
him well, even if you cannot love him. And believe
this: if you do not treat him well, you shall
be the one to suffer. To-morrow morning, begin
making some good moccasins for him. I, myself,
shall cut out his clothes, and he can sew them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So began a new life for Long Arrow. If the
woman did not love him, she at least treated him
well. He did everything that he could think of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
to please Heavy Runner. He went hunting with
him, and brought home heavy loads of the meat
that he killed, and in every possible way was of
use to him. And yet he was not satisfied; he kept
saying to himself: &lsquo;I want to do something great
for this man who is so good to me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time passed. The boy grew up to be a fine
young man; good of heart and of fine appearance;
and at last Heavy Runner&rsquo;s woman loved him as
though he were her own son. But in one thing
he was very different from the other young men
of the camp: he made no close friends, and when
not needed by Heavy Runner he wandered much
by himself. Excepting his sister, whom he frequently
took for long walks, he had little to
say to any one, and so the people, all but she and
his foster parents, continued to believe him
crazy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One evening he said to Heavy Runner: &lsquo;Tell
me. What must one do to become a chief?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One must be very brave, must be fearless
when facing the enemy, and of very kind heart;
full of pity for the poor and the old and the sick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
and always anxious to help them,&rsquo; the chief
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I want to become a chief. What is
the first thing for me to do?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The first thing to do is to go to some far and
dangerous place, and get your medicine. That
is, something that will make you favored by the
gods, and bring you good luck in battle, and in
all matters of life,&rsquo; Heavy Runner told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That I shall do,&rsquo; said the young man, &lsquo;but,
first, will you not call in the chiefs, and the
medicine men and braves, and let me hear from
them where they went, and what they did to get
their medicine? I shall then have a better idea
of what I am to do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We will have in our lodge full of them,&rsquo; Heavy
Runner said. And the next morning he shouted
out invitations for a smoke, asking only the great
of the tribe to come to it. They came, filling the
lodge, and then, when the pipe was going the
round of the circle, he told why he had invited
them to the smoke; asked them to give their
experiences in their search for medicines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
&ldquo;One after another they told their adventures;
where they went; what they did; what they saw;
what narrow escapes from death they had. And
at last it came Spotted Bear&rsquo;s turn. But he refused
to give his experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;tell that crazy youth
about my adventure? Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t waste
my breath on him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But he is a poor boy; he wants to know; you
might tell it him in a short way,&rsquo; pleaded Heavy
Runner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I will tell it; not for his benefit, for he
is crazy, and would not understand; but I will
tell it so that you all may know what I did,&rsquo; the
surly one answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From this very place I traveled southward
along the foot of the mountains. Seven days and
seven nights I traveled, stopping only now and
then for a short rest and sleeping very little, and
on the morning after the seventh night I arrived
at the shore of a small lake. There I met a
stranger man who asked me what I sought, and
I told him that I was wandering in search of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
strong, a powerful medicine. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;in such a matter I cannot help you. Go on
south for three days and three nights, and you
will find a man who will give you what you seek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I went on. Stopping only for short rests,
and rarely sleeping, I traveled south for three
days and three nights from that place, and in the
morning after the third night arrived at a long,
wide lake running away back in the mountains.
I looked at it, looked at the mountains, turning
this way, that way, and when I turned a last
time, lo! there in front of me stood a man, fierce
of face, dressed in beautiful strange clothing,
wrapped in a robe such as I had never seen before,
and carrying a spear with a big, flint point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;What do you here?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Are you
not afraid to come to this, the home of us gods
of the deep waters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I answered that I was not afraid; that I
feared neither gods nor men, nor any animal of
the earth, the sky, or the deep waters. And at
that he cried out: &ldquo;You are brave! The brave
shall be rewarded! Come with me!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;I went with him to his lodge. I am promised
to secrecy; I dare not tell you where it was. He
took me in and fed me, and gave me this robe
that I am wearing, this medicine robe, and taught
me the prayers and ceremony that goes with it.
I asked him what kind of a robe it was, and he
answered that it was the skin of an elk-dog;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
an animal as large as an elk, and, like the dog,
useful for carrying burdens. The gods, he said,
rode them, guided them wherever they wanted
to go.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
Po-no-ka-mi-ta (elk-dog). The horse. <a href="#FNanchor_10">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Said I: &ldquo;May I have one of those elk-dogs
to ride home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;No! They are only for the gods to use,&rdquo;
he answered, and told me to go. I came home. I
have the robe. Here it is, proof of all that I have
told you. Ah! And this crazy youth would know
where I went, what I did! It is to laugh to think
of his going there!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pipe went a last round, and then the
chiefs and medicine men and braves went home.
As soon as they were gone Long Arrow said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
Heavy Runner: &lsquo;My chief, you know that I am
not crazy. I feel that I must go on adventure,
and I want to go where Spotted Bear went, and
prove to him that I can go as far and face as
many dangers as he did. Will you let me go, and
keep secret from every one whither I have gone
and for what purpose?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What you propose is just what I want you
to do,&rsquo; Heavy Runner answered. &lsquo;You shall
start to-morrow, taking with you all the moccasins
and other things you will need, and your
foster mother and I will tell no one anything
about you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At break of day the next morning, while all
the people of the great camp still slept, Long
Arrow started on his journey of discovery.
Straight south he went, by day and by night,
resting and sleeping at long intervals, and then
only for a very short time. On the third day he
arrived at the small lake that Spotted Bear had
mentioned, and there met the man of that place,
even as he had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What seek you?&rsquo; the man asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Knowledge! Medicine! The way to become
a chief!&rsquo; Long Arrow answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I cannot help you. Go on south for seven
days and seven nights, and you will come to a
great lake, and there you will meet a man who
can help you if he cares to do so. It may be that
he will not even show himself to you, but anyhow
it is worth your while to go there and try
to meet him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long Arrow went on for seven days and
seven nights, resting and sleeping less than ever,
eating nothing except now and then a piece of
dry meat not so large as his hand. Early in the
morning after the seventh night, exhausted,
hardly able to drag one foot after the other, he
came to the great lake, and some distance back
from its shore fell down on the grass and fell
into a sound sleep. It was late afternoon when
he awoke, and, opening his eyes, he was surprised
to see a boy standing beside him. He
was a beautiful child, by far the most perfect
of form and feature that Long Arrow had
ever seen; so beautiful that it did not seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
possible he could be of this earth, a child of
the people of this earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said the boy to him: &lsquo;I have been waiting
here a long time for you to awake. My father
invites you to his home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall be glad to visit him,&rsquo; Long Arrow
answered, and sprang up, put on his weapons,
and was ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy led him straight to the shore of the
lake, and there cried out: &lsquo;Do not be afraid,
follow me!&rsquo; And having said that, changed into
a snipe, entered the water and disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long Arrow was afraid, terribly afraid of the
deep, dark water, and the mystery of a place
where a child could suddenly become a snipe.
But he said to himself: &lsquo;If I fail in my search
for a medicine it shall be through no fault of
mine,&rsquo; and he entered the water. Lo! it did not
wet him; did not touch him. It parted before
him and he went on down the sloping, sandy
bottom of the lake, and soon saw, close ahead, a
large, fine lodge, on which were painted in red
and black the figures of two strange animals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
The boy, arrived at the doorway of the lodge,
changed suddenly from a snipe back to his natural
self, and cried out: &lsquo;Follow me! Here you
will be welcome,&rsquo; and went in. Long Arrow,
following him, found himself facing a fine-looking
man at the back of the lodge. He was sitting
cross-legged on his couch, and wore a beautiful
black robe which entirely covered his legs and
feet. &lsquo;You are welcome here, my son, be seated,&rsquo;
said the man, and told his wife to prepare food
for his guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long Arrow looked about him. On all sides
the lodge was hung with beautiful shields, war
clothes, weapons, handsomely painted and fringed
pouches of sacred medicines, and a porcupine-quill
embroidered belt of such brilliant colors
that it shamed the rainbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman of the lodge soon set food before
Long Arrow, and, having long fasted, he ate
largely. The man then filled and lighted a pipe,
passed it to his guest, and said: &lsquo;I knew that you
were coming, and I wondered if you would have
the courage to follow my son from the shore of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
this lake down here to my lodge. Not long ago
a man of your people came here, but he was
afraid; he would not follow my son. And there
he made a great mistake. I was going to give
him the most valuable present ever given by
gods to men. As it was, I went out to him where
he sat far back from the shore, and gave him the
tanned hide of an elk-dog, and sent him home.
He was not worthy of a better present. But
you are different. I shall give you something of
great value. Remain here with us a few days.
My son shall show you my band of elk-dogs;
you shall hunt and kill meat for us; and when
you go, then you shall have the great present.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy went out with Long Arrow and
showed him the elk-dogs. They came running
from the timber out upon the open prairie at the
foot of the lake, and were a wonderful sight.
They were far larger than an elk, of shining black
color, had tails of long hair, and there was long
hair all along the top of their necks and hanging
down their foreheads from between their restless
ears. They were of all sizes, from suckling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
young to old males and females, and all were
very fat and playful, even the oldest of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Young man of the earth,&rsquo; said the boy, &lsquo;if
you are wise and watchful, these animals and
my father&rsquo;s black robe and his many-colored
belt may be your present: the three go together.
You have noticed that my father always keeps
his feet covered with the black robe; that when
he arises and goes out of the lodge he is very
careful to keep the robe lowered around him,
like a dragging woman&rsquo;s dress, so that his feet
cannot be seen. Well, you have but to see those
feet, and anything that you ask for will be
yours.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall do my best to see those feet,&rsquo; said
Long Arrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Several days passed. The old people of the
lodge were very kind to Long Arrow, and he in
turn did his best to please them, hunting most
all of the time and bringing in much meat. And
what time he was not hunting, he would sit close
to the herd of beautiful elk-dogs and watch them
feed and play. When in the lodge he watched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
closely for a sight of the old man&rsquo;s feet, but he
ever kept them closely covered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last, one evening, the old man started to
go out of the lodge, keeping his robe well down
upon the ground about him, but as he stepped
over the low front of the doorway his right knee
raised the robe and Long Arrow saw his left
foot; and lo! it was not a human foot: it was
the hoof, the round, hard hoof of an elk-dog! He
gave a cry of surprise at the sight, and the old
man, realizing what had happened, exclaimed:
&lsquo;Hai-yo! How careless of me! Well, it cannot
be helped, it must have been fated that he should
see it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went on out, and upon returning took no
pains to conceal his feet: both of them and the
ankles were those of the elk-dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you have seen my feet, so you can now
tell me what I shall give you,&rsquo; said the old man,
as he resumed his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, don&rsquo;t hesitate; speak right out; ask
for the three things,&rsquo; whispered the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Long Arrow, taking courage, answered:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
&lsquo;Give me three things: your black robe, your
many-colored belt, and your elk-dogs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha! You ask a great deal,&rsquo; the old man
cried, &lsquo;but, because you are brave and good-hearted
and not lazy, you shall have the robe
and the belt and a part of my band of elk-dogs.
The robe and the belt are the elk-dog medicine.
Without them you could never catch and use the
animals. There are many prayers and songs and
a long ceremony that go with them, and I have
to teach it all to you. When you have thoroughly
learned them, then you shall go home with your
presents.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long Arrow was many evenings learning
them all, but at last he could repeat every one
of them perfectly, and dance the dances as well
as the old man himself, and finally the latter
told him one evening:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have done well. I am glad that my
elk-dogs and my medicines are to be in your
hands. You may start for home to-morrow.
And now, listen! Take good heed of what I am
about to tell you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;When you leave here, wearing the black
robe and the belt, you are to travel for three
days and three nights and never once look back.
When you rest, you are to face the north. Be
sure, now, that, traveling or resting, you never
once look back. The elk-dogs will not at first
follow you, but on the third day of your homeward
journey you will hear them coming behind
you. Even then you must not look back, but
keep on walking. After a time they will come
on right beside you, and with a rope that I shall
give you, you will catch one of them and mount
and ride it, and all the others will follow you.
They will always do that so long as you have the
black robe. Lose that, and you lose your animals;
they will become wild, and you will never be
able to catch and train them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As you say, so shall I do,&rsquo; Long Arrow
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And early the next morning the old man gave
him the robe, the belt, and a rope made from
the head hair of buffalo bulls, and he started for
home, keeping ever in mind and obeying carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
the old man&rsquo;s instructions. At times he had his
doubts of the old man. Perhaps a big joke was
being played upon him; the elk-dogs would not
come on the third day, nor any other day! But
he would soon cast off such thoughts, and go on
with renewed faith that all would be well with
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And on the third day he heard behind him
the thunder of many hard hoofs upon the hard
plain; the occasional whinnying that he had
learned to love so well! And then, an old female
leading them, the elk-dogs came close up beside
him, and he caught and mounted one of them,
and rode on. How happy he was! He realized
what this would mean for himself and for the
people. These elk-dogs would rapidly increase in
number; there would soon be enough of them for
all the people, and then they would ride instead
of walk, and their lodges and all their belongings
would be carried by the animals. &lsquo;And now I can
do something for those who have been so good to
me,&rsquo; he said to himself, and rode on, singing the
new songs that he had learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
&ldquo;It was late in the afternoon on the day that
he approached the camp. All the men had returned
from the hunt; every one was outside the
lodges, resting in the warm sunshine. The first
to discover him gave a shout of surprise and
alarm. All the people sprang up and stood gazing
at the strange sight. They asked one another
what the strange big black animals could be?
And was it really a man sitting astride one of
them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is some fierce god bringing his fierce
animals to destroy us,&rsquo; shouted Spotted Bear,
the very man who had so contemptuously used
Long Arrow, who had not had the courage to
follow the boy-snipe into the water. Again he
cried out: &lsquo;Surely it is an evil one coming to
destroy us.&rsquo; And he fled, and all the people fled
with him and took to the brush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long Arrow rode into camp and dismounted
at Heavy Runner&rsquo;s lodge, and all the elk-dogs
came up and crowded around him and the
one of them that he had been riding. &lsquo;Heavy
Runner! Heavy Runner!&rsquo; he shouted. &lsquo;Be not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
afraid! I am only your son, come back to
you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavy Runner heard the well-known voice
and was no longer afraid. He came hurrying
from the brush, all the people following him, and
they all crowded around Long Arrow and his
strange animals. Said the youth then: &lsquo;Only
father and mother that I ever knew, I have
brought to you, excepting one female and one
male, all these strange and useful animals. As
you see, they can be ridden; you will no longer
have to walk. Also, they will carry for you everything
that is yours. I am glad that I can give
them to you, both of you who have been so good
to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How generous of you!&rsquo; Heavy Runner cried.
But his wife could say nothing: she embraced
Long Arrow and wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where did you get the strange black ones?&rsquo;
a chief asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will tell you all about it this evening; I am
cautioned not to talk about the gods in the daytime,&rsquo;
Long Arrow answered. And after picketing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
the animal he had ridden on good grass, and
driving the others out from camp, he went into
the lodge and rested.</p>

<div class="caption">GOING-TO-THE-SUN CHALET, UPPER ST. MARY&rsquo;S LAKE</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;That evening all the chiefs and warriors
came into the lodge, Spotted Bear with them,
and he told all about his strange adventures,
of his life with the Under-Water People, and
how the old man had given him the elk-dogs,
and the black robe and the belt that he wore.
And, of course, he told about Spotted Bear&rsquo;s
cowardice in failing to follow the boy-snipe into
the water, and he fled from the lodge, and his
chieftainship dropped from him as he fled. Ever
afterward he was no more than a woman in that
great camp; never again was he allowed to sit
with the chiefs and warriors! And when Long
Arrow had finished telling them all about his
wonderful adventures, the chief cried out: &lsquo;We
will move camp to that lake of the Under-Water
People. They have more elk-dogs; we will ask
for them, give anything to obtain possession
of such valuable animals.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They moved south to the lake, but, search
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
as they would, could find no elk-dogs, nor did
the boy-snipe nor any of the Under-Water People
appear, although the medicine men made sacrifice
to them and prayed them to show themselves.
They did discover, however, that above
this lake was another and a longer one, hemmed
in by still higher mountains, and so they named
the two the Inside Lakes, and that is the name
they bear to this day.&rdquo;</p>


<h3><i>August 12.</i></h3>

<p>Last night we all gathered in Stabs-by-Mistake&rsquo;s
lodge, and, while the pipe was filled and
refilled, and passed from hand to hand on many
rounds, we had more tales, strange and weird, of
the people of the ancient days. One that our
host told especially interested me, and here it
is, literally translated for your perusal. It was
the story, he said, of</p>


<h4>&ldquo;ONE HORN, SHAMER OF CROWS</h4>

<p>&ldquo;It was in the long ago time, when all three
of our tribes, the Blackfeet proper, the Bloods,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
and we, the Pikun&prime;i, whom the whites mistakenly
call Blackfeet, were still living in the North
country. The camp of the Pikun&prime;i was on Big
River, close up to the foot of the mountains.
One of the great chiefs of the tribe was One
Horn. Very brave he was, and very rich, for his
band of horses numbered more than a hundred
head. He had two wives, sisters, but no children.
Many orphans called him father, for he had poor
old couples care for them, and kept them all well
supplied with meat and with skins for clothing.
He was a peculiar man, was One Horn. He seldom
visited in other lodges, and was a man of
few words; it was always difficult to get him to
tell of his brave deeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One summer night One Horn had an uneasy
dream about his horses, and with the first faint
light of coming day arose, washed and dressed
himself, and took up his weapons and went out
to see if his herd was anywhere in sight. He
climbed to a little rise on the edge of the plain,
saw them quietly feeding at a distance, and then
saw something else: two men asleep in a <i>coul&eacute;e</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
close under the little rise. They were, he thought,
young men of the camp, watchers of the horse
herds, and he concluded to surprise them and
scold them for sleeping when they should be
watching the plains for the approach of enemies.
More from habit than anything else, he drew his
bow, fitted a war arrow to it, and then, creeping
close to the sleeping ones, shouted: &lsquo;Awake!
You lazy ones, awake!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To his great surprise they were two enemies,
who sprang up at the sound of his voice, and he
shot one of them in the breast, and he fell, and as
the other turned and ran, he fired an arrow at
him and struck him in the back, but he kept on
running, the arrow dangling and swaying from
his back, and he soon disappeared in the thick
brush bordering the river. One Horn went back
to camp and sent the warriors out to look for the
wounded man, but they never found him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although a very brave warrior, One Horn&rsquo;s
voice was always for peace. He thought much
about the wars of tribe against tribe and the great
loss of lives they caused, and wished that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
could put an end to it all. He counted up the different
tribes with whom his people were at war&mdash;the
Sioux, the Assiniboines, Cheyennes, Pawnees,
Snakes, Bannocks, Pend d&rsquo;Oreilles, Flatheads,
Nez Perc&eacute;s, Kootenai, and Crows. And
the worst of them all were the Crows. He determined
to go to the Crows and try to make peace
between them and his people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another thought came to him: It was best
to say nothing to his people about his plan, for
many would make serious objection to it. If he
succeeded, they should know all about it upon
his return. If he failed, he would never tell them
where he had been. So, one evening, he gave his
women orders what to do, and kept his horses
close in around his lodge. Late that night, when
all the camp was asleep, down came the lodge,
the pack and travois horses were quietly loaded,
and he and his women headed southward, he
driving his big herd in the lead. The next morning
the people found that they had a mystery
that they could not solve: One Horn was gone
with all his belongings, gone without telling them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
one word of his intentions! Why had he left
them so secretly, and whither had he gone?
They never ceased talking about it and wishing
that he would return; they felt safe when he
was at their backs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Traveling south day after day along the foot
of the mountains, One Horn and his women at
last struck the River-of-Many-Chiefs-Gathering,
and, following it up, came in sight of the big
prairies at the foot of the lower one of these Inside
Lakes. It was then dusk, but not so dark but
what they could see that there was a big camp
of people at the edge of the timber bordering the
lake shore. Said One Horn, &lsquo;They must be the
ones I seek, the Mountain Crows. As soon as
they sleep, we will go on and put up our lodge
near theirs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Early the next morning an old man stepped
out from his lodge, and saw a strange lodge
standing by itself just outside the circle of the
big camp. He looked at it a long time, and the
growing light at last enabled him to see that there
were two huge bears painted on its new white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
leather skin. He turned and hurried to the lodge
of the head chief of the camp, aroused him, and
cried: &lsquo;Here is a mystery; something to be looked
into: just outside the circle of our camp a strange
lodge is standing. It belongs not to us Mountain
Crows, nor to our brothers, the River Crows. I
know that, for it has painted upon it two big
bears, and neither of our tribes has that medicine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chief hurried to get up and dress, and so
did others, and they soon left their lodges and
approached the strange lodge. There was a fire
within it. Voices were heard in low-toned conversation.
Close around a few horses were
picketed, and farther out grazed a large band of
them, mostly grays and blacks. It was evident
that the owner of the lodge was a chief, a bear
medicine man, a very rich man. The Crow chief
thrust aside the door curtain of the lodge, and
entered, the others following. A fine-appearing
man at the back of it gave them the sign for
welcome, and motioned them where to sit. He
lifted a big filled pipe and lighted it, and passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
it. The Crow chief smoked first, and then one by
one those with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having passed on the pipe, the Crow chief
signed to the stranger: &lsquo;You are a Blackfoot?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I am a Blackfoot,&rsquo; One Horn answered.
&lsquo;You are wondering why I, an enemy, have come
here and set up my lodge beside you. You shall
know! I have come to try to make peace between
your people and my people. I am tired of all this
war, and its wasting of men&rsquo;s lives, and making
women and children mourn.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You say well. Your talk deserves attention.
Peace between us would be good for us both.
I will talk to my people about it,&rsquo; said the Crow
chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And just then One Horn&rsquo;s women set before
him and the other Crows dishes of rich berry
pemmican, the best of dried meat and back fat,
and they ate with the outside chief. Then they
smoked again and went home, the Crow chief
saying that he would soon give a call for a council,
and would send for the Blackfoot to join in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not until near sunset, however, that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
youth came to invite One Horn to the Crow
chief&rsquo;s lodge. He found assembled there all the
head men of the tribe, and the chief told him
that, after long talk, they had decided that they,
too, were tired of war, and would be glad to make
peace with the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But be not in a hurry to return home,&rsquo; the
Crow chief concluded. &lsquo;Make us a long visit,
and during it we will decide together where and
when our two tribes shall meet to make this
lasting peace treaty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answered One Horn: &lsquo;I shall be glad to
camp here with you for the rest of this moon.&rsquo;
And all those present signed to him: &lsquo;Yes. Remain
here with us for a time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One Horn and the Crow chief became friends.
They hunted together, visited often in each
other&rsquo;s lodge, and together were invited to other
lodges to feast and smoke, and join in the warriors&rsquo;
tales of raids and battles and adventures
along far trails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The River Crows were at this time encamped
just over the ridge from the Inside Lakes, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
Little River, and some of them came frequently
to visit their Mountain brothers at the foot of
the lakes. Among others came a man who was
always counting his <i>coups</i>. In a gathering of the
warriors he would wait until all had told what
they had done in war against their enemies, and
then he would count one <i>coup</i>, only one, that was
far greater than any of theirs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On a day when One Horn was visiting in the
Crow chief&rsquo;s lodge, this man was one of the
guests. The talk was of war, and after many there
had told what they had done, he said that, with
a friend, he was approaching the Blackfeet camp,
and they were discovered and surrounded by all
the warriors of the tribe. His friend soon fell,
as full of arrows as a porcupine is full of quills,
but that he, charging this way, that way, shooting
arrows fast and killing many Blackfeet, made
them give way before him and he escaped from
them, although wounded in the back. Later on,
when safe from pursuit, he had drawn out the
arrow, and still had it, proof enough of the truth
of his tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
&ldquo;This man then turned to One Horn, and said,
by signs, of course, &lsquo;We have all of us here told
about our fights, and now it is your turn: tell of
your brave deeds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have nothing to say that will interest
you; mine have been just the common experiences
of those who go on raids. No, I have nothing
to say,&rsquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you must tell us one great thing that
you have done,&rsquo; the River Crow insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And again One Horn answered: &lsquo;What I
have done would not interest you. I have nothing
to say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man then turned to the Mountain Crow
chief and said: &lsquo;This is a poor kind of a friend for
you to have! He has done nothing; he is no chief,
he is a woman!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not know for sure, but I think that he
is a chief, that he has a big war record,&rsquo; the host
answered him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then the guests went their several ways,
the River Crow laughing shrilly, contemptuously,
as he left the lodge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
&ldquo;It was not long after this that the River Crow
came over again from Little River, and again
was one of a party of guests in the lodge of the
chief of the Mountain Crows. Once more the talk
was of war, and when it came this man&rsquo;s turn
to talk, he drew an arrow from his quiver, laid
it on the ground in front of him, and said: &lsquo;There!
No one here, nor in the camp of the Mountain
Crows and the camp of the River Crows, has
ever equaled what that stands for. That is the
arrow that I drew from my back after my partner
was killed, and I fought my way single-handed
through the hundreds of Blackfeet warriors,
killing many of them, and so frightening them
that they dared not pursue me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One Horn leaned over, looked at the arrow,
and gave an exclamation of disgust: &lsquo;That is
my arrow,&rsquo; he signed. &lsquo;I know this man now.
At dawn, one morning, I discovered him and his
partner asleep near our camp. I crept up to them
and shouted, thinking that they were our horseherd
watchers, and when they sprang up, I saw
that they were enemies. I shot one of them dead.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
This man turned and ran, never even firing at
me, and I shot an arrow into his back, but he
kept on going and escaped from me in the brush!
Yes. That is the very arrow I shot into him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is a lie! A big lie!&rsquo; the River Crow said,
and signed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For answer to that, One Horn went to the
door of the lodge and shouted to his women to
bring over his quiver of arrows. It was soon
handed in to him, and he said: &lsquo;I have here two
kinds of arrows: hunting arrows and war arrows.
Here are the war arrows.&rsquo; And he laid them beside
the arrow in front of the boaster. All there
saw at once that they were exactly like it in
every way, had the same private mark just
back of the point. And suddenly, with jeers and
cries of &lsquo;Liar!&rsquo; &lsquo;Coward!&rsquo; they took handfuls of
ashes and earth from the fireplace and threw
them in the River Crow&rsquo;s face and on his head,
and he ran for the door and was gone, leaving the
arrow behind. One Horn picked it up and put it
in his quiver, and said: &lsquo;That no doubt ends his
lying bragging!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
&ldquo;Some days after this exposure of his lying,
the River Crow, watching his chance, entered
the lodge of the Mountain Crow chief and said
to him: &lsquo;That Blackfoot has shamed me. I was
a chief, but now all people laugh at me. I want
revenge. Let me kill that friend of yours and I
will give you three of my best horses!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What you ask is impossible!&rsquo; the chief replied.
&lsquo;He is my friend! We have smoked together,
have eaten together. I cannot allow you
to kill him. And for your lying you deserve what
you got!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The River Crow sneaked away, but on the
next evening, when none but the chief and his
women were at home, he came again. And this
time he said: &lsquo;Let me do what I want to do; you
know what that is; and I will give you five of my
best horses and my beautiful young daughter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this time the chief did not give him a
short answer. He thought over the offer for a
long time. He knew that it would be a terrible
thing to betray his Blackfoot friend, but the
temptation was great. His women were getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
old. He wanted that beautiful girl. And at last
he gave way to the temptation: &lsquo;It shall be as
you wish,&rsquo; he told the man. &lsquo;All is arranged for
to-morrow; we go with the hunters on a big buffalo
hunt, and there will be no chance for you to
do what you want to do. Come the day after to-morrow
and I will help you&mdash;if you need my
help&mdash;to kill the Blackfoot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very early the next morning the hunters
started out after buffalo, One Horn taking with
him one of his women to help in the butchering
and packing in of the meat. They were no sooner
gone than one of the Crow chief&rsquo;s women hurried
to One Horn&rsquo;s lodge and told his other
woman all about the plan to kill him. She told
it because she was jealous; she did not want her
man to take another wife!</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it was that, when One Horn came home
that evening, this wife ran to him and embraced
and kissed him as though she would never let
him out of her arms. This strong showing of love
was unusual with her, and he asked her the cause
for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Because to-morrow you are to die, and sister
and I are to become slaves. See now what you
have done by coming to try to make peace with
these Crows!&rsquo; And she told him all about the plot
to end his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But One Horn just laughed: &lsquo;Wipe away your
tears and take courage,&rsquo; he told her. &lsquo;These
Crows will not kill me, a bear medicine man, and
a chief. They cannot kill me. I will show you
to-morrow something that will surprise you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That night he kept his favorite war horse
picketed close to his lodge, and the next morning
he carefully dressed himself in his beautiful war
clothes, painted himself and his horse, took his
bow and arrows, his shield and spear, and rode
into the center of the big camp, and called upon
the Crow chief to come out. He did come out,
also dressed for battle, and One Horn cried out to
him, at the same time making signs, so that he
would be sure to understand, &lsquo;Your plot is discovered.
So you and that River Crow are going
to kill me. Where is he? Call him. I want to fight
you both. I am a bear. I fight like a bear. Come!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
Hurry! Let us fight. Ha! I am going to fight
my true friend, the chief of the Mountain Crows,
he who smoked and ate with me, he who was going
to join me in making a lasting peace between
our two tribes. Come! Let us fight! Shall
it be on horseback or afoot? I give you the
choice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Crow chief gave him no answer. Some
of the people, looking on, were beginning to show
their anger and shame at his betrayal of a friend.
He turned and went back into his lodge, and
would not come out again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While this was going on, several men had
hurried to the River Crow man, stopping in the
far end of camp: &lsquo;Your plan to kill the Blackfoot
is discovered, and he is dressed and armed and
mounted, waiting to fight you. He is like a raging
grizzly, and his, you know, is the bear medicine.
What are you going to do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man did not answer them. He mounted
his horse, and, hidden from One Horn&rsquo;s sight by
the lodges, struck out for the River Crow camp
on Little River, and fear was with him. He often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
looked back to see if he were being pursued by
this dreadful bear medicine man who had once
wounded him, and was now so anxious to meet
him face to face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One Horn rode back to his lodge. &lsquo;Take down
the lodge, pack up everything. We will not stay
another day with these treacherous Crows,&rsquo; he
told them, and rounded up and caught what
horses were needed for packing and riding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just before they were ready to leave, the
Crow chief sent one of his women to say to One
Horn that he was sorry for what he had done,
very sorry that he had ever listened to the River
Crow, and wanted to make reparation. He
wanted to give his Blackfoot friend ten head of
horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell him that I will not accept anything from
him,&rsquo; One Horn answered the woman. And he
and his outfit started for the north and were soon
out of sight of the Crow camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some days afterward they arrived at the camp
of their people on the Big River of the North, and
had no sooner set up their lodge than One Horn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
called a council of the chiefs and told them where
he had been and for what purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Although I accomplished nothing, I am glad
I went,&rsquo; he told them. &lsquo;I now know the Crows.
They are liars all, and not to be trusted. I advise
that we begin a steady war against them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other chiefs agreed to that. Messengers
were sent to the brother tribes, the Bloods and
the North Blackfeet, and to the Gros Ventres,
friends of the Blackfeet, and the war was started.
Little by little, summer after summer, they drove
the Crows southward, killing many of them, and
were not satisfied until they forced them to the
country south of the Elk River,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> where they have
ever since remained. So, because of their treachery,
the Crows lost a great and rich country.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><i>August 18.</i></h3>


<h4>THE ELK MEDICINE CEREMONY</h4>

<p>Not in many, many years have I been so affected
as I was this morning. For some days I
have had a high fever, and have slept but little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
at night. In-si-mak&prime;-i (Growth Woman), Yellow
Wolf&rsquo;s wife, had been doctoring me with the good
old remedy for fevers, sweet sage tea, but it
seemed to have no effect. So Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill
announced that he would have
his Elk Medicine ceremony for my benefit, and
that he was sure that it would cure me of my illness.
We had it this morning, and to-night I
have a normal pulse and the fever has left me.
I will not go so far as to say that it was his prayers
that cured me,&mdash;prayers far better, far more
earnest than those of any Christian preacher I
ever heard,&mdash;but yet, I am well! To me, all
religions are nothing more than the codified
superstitions of the ages, but of them all, Christian
and pagan, I like best the faith of these, my
people, faith that the sun is the conservator of
all life and the orderly ruler of this, our earth.
And what absolute faith they have in their Sun-religion!
Should Christians live as closely to
their beliefs as the Blackfeet do to the laws of
conduct given them by their Sun god, what a
different, what a happy world this would be!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
Before I relate the details of the ceremony, I
must tell something of the medicine itself.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet believe that, when they lie
down and sleep, their shadows, or, as we say,
their souls, their spiritualities, leave the body
and go on far adventure. Their name for
this is Ni-pup&prime;-o-kan (my dream; my vision);
and when they awake they really believe that
they have experienced all the incidents of their
dream, and relate them as having been of actual
fact.</p>

<p>When men and animals were first created, they
had a common language, and the latter had the
power to change themselves at will into the form
of man. It was in that long ago time that a man
seeking knowledge, and praying earnestly for it,
was in his vision visited by an elk in the form of
a man, whose name was Po-no-kai&prime;-&ucirc;t-s&#301;n-in-ah
(Elk-Tongue Chief).</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard you praying, asking for help.
What is it you want? Perhaps I can help you,&rdquo;
the elk man said.</p>

<p>The man answered: &ldquo;I seek some way to relieve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
my people from sickness; some way to give
them long life and happiness. Help me if you
can do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The elk man answered: &ldquo;I can help you; I will
help you. Through what was given me in my
vision I am in great favor with the sun, and all
the gods of the earth, the deep waters, and the
blue above. That medicine you shall have. I
give it to you now!&rdquo; And having said that, he
gave the man a painted lodge, a medicine pipestem,
beautifully decorated with a down-hanging
set of tail feathers of the sage hen, and wound
with strips of the fur of the bear and various water
animals. And with it, wrapped in clean buckskins,
were the skins of birds and animals, all
those that live upon the water and in the water,
and feed upon the life in the water, fish, and all
the various water insects. And having given the
man all this, he taught him how to use it, with
all the prayers and ceremonies that go with it.
The man took all this to his home, and used it,
and found that it was great medicine, and ever
since that time the Elk Medicine Lodge and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
things that go with it have been handed down
from generation to generation, to this day.</p>

<p>So now we come to the ceremony that was
given to-day for the curing of my illness. It was
my lucky day! Early in the morning Mr. Herford
T. Cowling, chief photographer for the United
States Reclamation Service, arrived at the Great
Northern Railway Company&rsquo;s St. Mary&rsquo;s Camp
and I went to him and asked if he would take
moving pictures of the ceremony, provided the
Indians were willing to have him do it. He enthusiastically
replied that he would be very glad
to take it all in with his crank-machine, so I
went to my people to ask if they would permit
it to be done. They objected, saying that the
ceremony was so sacred that even the presence
of white people, antagonistic all of them to their
religion, would profane it. They did not count
me. I was one of them!</p>

<p>Said I: &ldquo;Listen, my relatives, and brothers
all! We are all soon to die, and as we pass away
the whole of the old life goes with us. Your
children, taken away from you by the whites,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
put in school and taught the white men&rsquo;s religion
and manner of living, will know nothing about
the way their fathers lived unless I put it all
down in writing for all time to come. That I am
doing. And how much more interesting it will
be if I can have pictures to go with it! Say yes!
Let us have, with this that you are to do to-day,
the living pictures of it all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There followed a long silence, all considering
my request. Finally, my best of friends, Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill,
wiped tears from
his eyes, and said, brokenly: &ldquo;Ap-i-kun&prime;-i is right.
The whites take our children from us and teach
them false beliefs. But they teach them to read,
and it may be, that, after we have all gone on to
the Sand Hills,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> they will read our brother&rsquo;s
writings and see us as we were, making our
prayers to the gods, and, having read and seen
the pictures of it all, return to the one true faith.
I say, let the picture man come!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

The Sand Hills (Sp&auml;t-si-kwo). The drear after-life abode

imitation of life. <a href="#FNanchor_12">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ai! Ai! Let him come!&rdquo; all cried, and I sent
a messenger for him.</p>

<p>During the ceremony he took six hundred feet
of it, and so for all time to come is preserved
the interesting ceremony of the Elk Medicine.</p>

<p>The ceremony is always given in a closed
lodge, but this time we threw the front of it wide
open, so that the lens of that moving-picture
machine could take it all in.</p>

<p>As I have said, Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill
is old, feeble, half-blind, and is himself
unable to go through parts of the ceremony. So,
on the evening before this came off, he sent for
Chief Crow and his wife, living near, to help
him out. Chief Crow is also a medicine man, his
wife, of course, a medicine woman, and he owns
the Seizer&rsquo;s medicine pipe. Four other medicine
men were there, all of them taking part in the
ceremony. In each of the three tribes of the
Blackfeet there is a secret society of the medicine
men, and the members help one another in their
ceremonies, and they and they only can dance
with the sacred symbols of their rites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
When I went into the lodge the sacred medicines
were hanging directly over the owner&rsquo;s
couch, opposite the doorway. They were the
sacred pipestem and many skins of water animals
and birds enclosed in various wrappings,
and a buffalo rawhide painted pouch containing
sacks of various colored sacred paints. On Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill&rsquo;s
left sat his medicine
wife. I took my seat close to him on his
right. Back of me, and all around the right side
of the lodge from me, were a number of women.
On the other side, opposite them, were the men
and Chief Crow&rsquo;s medicine wife.</p>

<p>The ceremony opened with a prayer by Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill,
beseeching the
gods to look with favor upon what was to be
done. Then his wife arose and undid the fastenings
of the medicines, and slowly, reverently,
laid them on the couch between her and her
husband. The opening song then began, the song
of Po-no-kai&prime;-&ucirc;t-s&#301;n-in-ah (Elk-Tongue Chief).
Oh, how I would like to inscribe that song here!
Alice Fletcher says&mdash;and I know that she is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
right&mdash;that all Indian music is classical. But
their tonal scale is far different from ours; we
have not one musical instrument that can reproduce
it. Never, never lived a white man who
could sing these Blackfeet songs. As a boy, year
after year, I tried to sing them, and always
failed; one has to take them in with his mother&rsquo;s
milk in order to sing them correctly.</p>

Chief Crow, medicine man, lifting the sacred roll of the medicine pipe; Medicine Weasel and Old Boy, singers</div>
</div>

<p>The song ended. The medicine woman, with
a pair of sacred red-painted willow tongs, took
a coal from the fire, placed it just in front of the
sacred medicines, and dropped upon it a pinch
of sweet grass. It burned, and, as the perfumed
smoke arose, she and her man grasped handfuls
of it and stroked their bodies, thus purifying
themselves before handling the medicines. Then,
all present joining in, they sang the song of the
real bear, the grizzly, while the medicine woman
unfastened the outer wrapping of the medicine
pipestem roll, which was bound with a strip of
fur from a grizzly&rsquo;s back; and at the same time,
in keeping with the time of the song, they made
the sign for the bear, closed hands held upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
each side of the head, representing its wide,
rounding ears.</p>

<p>That song finished, the song of the buffalo
began, the medicine man and the medicine
woman clenching their hands and alternately
putting one out before the other, representing
the deliberate, ponderous tread of the animals
as they traveled to and from the water. When
that song was finished&mdash;and it was one to stir
one&rsquo;s inmost soul&mdash;another wrapping, bound
with buffalo fur, was undone, and all present
besought the gods to have pity upon them.</p>

<p>Next came the fourth and last song, the song
of the beaver, chief of water animals. And while
it was being sung, the medicine woman unrolled
the fourth and last wrapping, and the sacred
medicine pipestem lay in sight of us all. At that
all the women gave shrill cries of triumph, of
victory; and all the medicine men beginning a
solemn chant to the Sun, Chief Crow advanced,
received from the medicine wife of my old friend
the sacred stem, and, extending the fan of
feathers drooping from it, held it aloft and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
danced in time with the song to the doorway of
the lodge and back again, and returned the stem
to my friend, who reverently took and embraced
it, and made a short prayer to the gods
for the long life, good health, and happiness
of us all, especially the little children of the
tribe.</p>

<p>Next came my part in the ceremony. My old
relative and friend felt around in his medicine
pouch, got out a small sack of <i>a-san&prime;</i>, the sacred
red paint, and painted my face with it, at the
same time beseeching the gods to give me, his
brother, Ap-i-kun&prime;-i, long life, good health, and
prosperity in all things. Then, having finished
the painting and the prayer, he had his wife hand
Chief Crow, his helper, the long red-painted
wooden flute that goes with the medicine, and
the latter, holding it aloft, danced with it almost
to the doorway of the lodge, where he blew several
soft, clear notes to the four corners of the
earth, and then returned the flute to the woman.
This was the Elk Medicine whistle, for imitating
the weird call of that animal, and was used just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
now to call him, the ancient Elk god, to give me
his favor, his pity. My friend then facing me,
upon his knees began the thunder song, in which
all joined, and, spreading his blanket-clad arms
wide to represent the thunder bird wings, hovered
before me, fanned me with his wings, the
intent being to waft to me from him the sacred
power. That over, all arose, and passing in line
from the lodge, Chief Crow leading, danced
through the camp and back again, and the
ceremony ended.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to express how I felt all through
the ceremony. I honored my people for their
sincere faith, their reverence for their gods. And
my thoughts went back to the time when they
were the lords of these plains and mountains and
knew not want. And not so very long ago they
were a tribe of three thousand members, and
now they number only eight or nine hundred,
and those who have gone have mostly gone from
want, from their susceptibility to disease because
of lack of proper nourishment. Do you
wonder that they feel bitterly toward the whites,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
who have taken from them everything that
made their life worth living?</p>

<h3><i>August 27.</i></h3>

<p>Because we were to-day to embark upon the
deep, dark waters of this lake, we yesterday had
a little ceremony on the shore, beseeching the
dread Under-Water People to have pity upon
us and allow us to pass in safety over their domain.
We had a little fire close to the water&rsquo;s
edge, and having filled and lighted his pipe with
a coal taken from it with his sacred red tongs,
old Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill smoked
and made his prayers, at the same time casting
into the water a little sack of his medicines as a
sacrifice to the gods. It was a short ceremony,
but satisfied even the most timid of the women
that all would be well with them during their
voyage upon the lake.</p>

<p>And so, where we once had rude rafts of logs,
lashed together with rawhide ropes, we this
morning embarked in good boats and went all
up the beautiful lake, past Red Eagle, and Little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
Chief, and Almost-a-Dog Mountains to the head
of the lake, and looking back at the slope of
Milk River Ridge saw the far-apart, enormous
footprints of Heavy Runner, keeper of the
buffalo.</p>

<p>Away back in ancient times, after Old Man
had made buffalo and they had increased and
covered the plains, they had great desire to wander
westward and see what might be on the other
side of the great mountains. The people&mdash;the
Blackfeet&mdash;learning of this were greatly distressed.
The far side of the mountains, away
west and still westward to the shores of the
Everywhere-Water, was the country of their
enemies, many tribes of them, and should they
get possession of the buffalo herds they would
never let them return. What to do about it they
had no idea, so they called upon Old Man for
help.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">UPPER TWO MEDICINE LAKE<br />
Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill (with pipe) propitiating the dreaded Under Water People</div>
</div>

<p>Said he: &ldquo;I made the buffalo to be plains animals,
and here upon these plains they shall remain,
and other-side tribes shall come to you
and ask permission to kill a few of them now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
and then. So, don&rsquo;t worry. Go home now and attend
to your affairs. All shall be well with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people went home. They saw that the
buffalo remained upon the plains in apparently
as great numbers as ever. But some of the hunters,
to learn for sure if they were all there, ascended
the different passes of the mountains and
went down the other side for some distance.
There were no buffalo, not even a few straggling
bulls on the other side, and they wondered how
Old Man was keeping them back. They soon
learned. In a vision it was revealed to an old
medicine man that a huge god, a man of enormous
stature, was patrolling the mountains
from far south to the everlasting snow of the
north, and with a club driving the buffalo back
eastward as fast as they came anywhere near
the summit of the range. And so it was that the
other tribes&mdash;those of the west&mdash;never got the
buffalo.</p>


<p class="break">On our way down the lake we passed the beautiful
Sun Camp and the chalets of the Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
Northern, perched upon the very spot where
Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill and I killed
many a bighorn and goat in times gone by. It
was a favorite wintering place of the animals,
for the winds kept the steep mountain slope
practically bare from snow. And passing the
mouth of the creek just above the camp, I remembered
that I had named it after Thomas,
and Colonel Robert, and the Honorable Cecil
Baring, of London, with whom I often hunted
back in the eighties. In those days there were
many bighorn and goats, and not a few grizzlies
back in the basin at the head of the creek. And
what amusing and sometimes exciting adventures
we had with them! One morning we espied
a big &ldquo;billy&rdquo; goat on a ledge, and just as we saw
him he moved to the back side of it and lay down,
showing only an inch or two of the top of his
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who will go up and rout him out, so that
I can get a shot?&rdquo; asked Colonel Baring,
and Jack Bean, of Yellowstone fame, volunteered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
It was to be a steep, almost straight-up climb,
so Jack laid down his rifle and started without
encumbrance of any kind. At last he reached
the shelf and stood up on it, and that &ldquo;billy&rdquo;
came for him, head down! And Jack! Never
have I seen a man come down a dangerous cliff
so fast as he did! And he kept coming, falling,
sliding, rolling, and then Colonel Baring fired
and dropped the goat, and man and animal came
the rest of the way to the foot of the place together!
We had been too much concerned for the
safety of our friend to laugh, but when he at last
stood up and faced us, bloody, half-naked, but
not seriously hurt, we roared. But Jack never
even smiled: &ldquo;Who would have thought that a
blankety-blank goat would go for a fellow!&rdquo; he
exclaimed; and he went to the creek to repair the
damages to his person.</p>

<p>On this day, halting here and there along the
lake, we took some views of the scenery and of
our people, and at sunset were back in our
lodges. For some of us it is a last trip over the
old, familiar ground. My two old friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill and Yellow Wolf,
must soon go on to their Shadow Land!</p>


<p class="break">We were not too tired to-night for story-telling,
so, after the children had been put to bed and
all was quiet, Takes-Gun-Ahead gave us the following,
the story of tobacco, which is called</p>


<h4>NA-WAK&prime;-O-SIS</h4>

<p>&ldquo;In that long ago time when the earth was
young, and people had not long been made, a
man threw some weeds upon a fire and found
that the odor, the smoke from their burning, was
very pleasant. That night he had a vision and
learned that this plant was strong medicine;
that, when smoked in a pipe, which his vision
explained to him how to make, it would be the
right thing with which to offer prayers to the
gods. He also taught the man the prayers and
all the ceremony that went with the prayers; and
told him how to plant the weeds, from the seeds
on their tops, so that he could always have plenty
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
&ldquo;This man was very much pleased with what
he had learned. He went to his three brother
medicine men and told them all about it, and
the four of them formed a society of themselves
and no others, for the raising of the weed and its
proper uses. But they were very stingy with this
weed, which they named <i>na-wak&prime;-o-sis</i>, and would
only now and then give the people a leaf of
it, although they raised large numbers of the
stalks in every summer time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young man named Lone Bull was very
anxious to become a member of this medicine
society, but because he had no medicines and
knew not the rites of it, he was told that he could
not join it. At that time the camp of the people
was close under Chief Mountain. He left it, with
his woman and his pack dogs, and moved up to
the river running out of the Inside Lakes, and
there set up his lodge. Said he then to his woman:
&lsquo;I have come up here to get medicines; in some
way to find things that will enable me to become
a raiser of <i>na-wak&prime;-o-sis</i>. If I can do that, I shall
be of great help to the people. Now, then, I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
going to hunt and collect all the medicine skins
I can find, and you stay at home, take care of
the lodge, gather wood, and cook what meat we
need. I shall bring in plenty of fat meat along
with the skins.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man went hunting every day, and the
woman remained at home. One day, when the
man was gone, she thought she heard singing;
beautiful singing; but look where she would she
could see no singers. She spoke to the man about
it when he came home that evening, and made
him feel uneasy: &lsquo;If you hear it again, look about
more carefully,&rsquo; he told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She heard it the next day, and this time located
it, right under the lodge. She went out
to the bank of the river and looked at the bank:
there, under the water, were beaver holes in it,
and beaver cuttings upon the sandy bottom, and
by that she knew that the lodge had been set
up above a bank beaver&rsquo;s home, and that beavers
were the singers. She went back to the lodge,
lay down and put her ear to the ground, and
could then hear them plainly, and was pleased.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
Their singing was so good that it was all that
she could do to stop listening to them and begin
cooking the evening meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Lone Bull came home that night she
told him what she had learned, but he could hear
nothing, although he put his ear close to the
ground. Nor could he hear the singing the next
evening, nor the next, although his woman could
hear it plainly. So now the woman got her knife
and cut a round hole in the ground, and Lone
Bull laid his head in it and could then hear the
singing. He told her to make the hole deeper;
larger. She did so, and cut clear through the
ground, and looking down he could see the beavers
sitting in their home, singing beautiful
songs, and dancing strange and beautiful dances
in time to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Younger brothers, have pity on me!&rsquo; he cried.
&lsquo;Oh, my young brothers, teach me your medicine!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They looked up and saw him, and one answered:
&lsquo;Close the hole that you have made,
because the light disturbs us, and we will soon
be with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
&ldquo;They soon came in through the doorway, four
fine-looking men, beautifully dressed. They had
changed themselves from beavers to men. They
took seats, and then one of them said to Lone
Bull: &lsquo;Elder brother, what is it that you want of
us? How can we help you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lone Bull told them what it was: his great
desire to obtain <i>na-wak&prime;-o-sis</i> and grow it for the
people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We have that plant; like us it is from the
water, a water medicine,&rsquo; the beaver man told
him; &lsquo;but before you can use it you have much
to do, much to learn. You have to learn all our
songs and prayers and dances and different ceremonies,
and gather for the ceremonies a skin of
every animal and bird that is of the water, one
of each except the beavers, and of them there
must be two. You know these animals and birds:
otter, mink, muskrat; different kinds of ducks;
the fish hawk, and all the other birds that get
their food from the life of the water. Why? Because
there are two great life-givers of this world:
the sun, which gives heat, and water, that makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
growth, and in our ceremonies the skins of these
different animals are symbols of the water.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall collect them all, so teach me everything,&rsquo;
Lone Bull told them. And they began
that very night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Day after day Lone Bull hunted the animals
and birds, brought in their skins for his woman
to cure, and night after night the beavers taught
him their medicine, all the sacred prayers and
dances and ceremonies of it. And at last he knew
them all thoroughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, one night, the beaver chief handed
him some stalks of <i>na-wak&prime;-o-sis</i>, the top stems
all covered with little round seeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;These,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;are the children of the big-leaved
plants; put them into the ground and they
will grow and make other plants that bear children.
And now, I must tell you just how to plant:
Gather a great, long, wide pile of old dry logs,
dry brush and weeds, and set it afire. The heat
from it will burn the ground, burn the sod, and
make everything soft under it. Then, when the
place has cooled, gather from around badger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
holes, squirrel holes, and wherever you can find
it, plenty of the brown earth they have thrown
out, and mix it with the burned black earth, so
that it will not pack hard around the seeds, and
keep them from coming up into the sunlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After you have taken all the seeds from the
stems, you must put them in a sack and not
touch them again with your hands. With an
antelope horn you will make row after row of
little holes all across the burned ground and only
a hand apart, and with a buffalo-horn spoon
drop a seed into each hole. When that is done,
and it will require a long time, you and yours are
to dance along each row of seed, singing the sacred
songs, your feet lightly pressing down the
ground over the seed. At the end of a row you
must step across to the next row, and dance backward
on that one, and forward on the next, and
so on until the last row has been pressed down,
and all your songs have been sung. Then you
can go away from the place for a time. Return
after one moon has passed, and you will find that
the young plants have grown above the ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
Watch them, that insects do not destroy them.
Give them water if the rains fail you. They will
grow all summer, and fade with the ripening of
the choke-cherries. Cut them then, care well for
them, and you and your people will have a
plenty for your winter smokes and ceremonies.
There! I have told you all!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was planting-time then. Lone Bull moved
right up to the foot of the lower one of the Inside
Lakes, and did everything that he had been told
to do, his wife helping him in every way. People
hunting from down Chief Mountain way came
and saw his growing plants, and went home and
told about them. The four medicine men just
laughed. &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; They cried. &lsquo;He has no <i>na-wak&prime;-o-sis</i>!
He wanted to join us and we would not let
him into our society. He but plants some useless
weed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But later on, just as their planting was getting
ripe, a terrible hailstorm came along and
destroyed it all; every leaf was cut into fine
pieces! They cried from grief! Then they said
among themselves: &lsquo;<i>Na-wak&prime;-o-sis</i> we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
have or our medicines will be without power. It
may be that this Lone Bull really has the true
plants: let us go up and see them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They went, all the people with them, and saw
that he had the sacred plants. The hailstorm had
come nowhere near his place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said they to him then: &lsquo;You have a big
planting, and we will help you gather it, and you
and we four will use it. You shall join us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lone Bull laughed long before he answered:
&lsquo;I need no help from you. You shall each have
a little of my planting for your own use, and you
shall pay me well for it. The rest, excepting what
I need, I shall give to the people, and hereafter
they will always have all that they need of the
plants.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as he said that he would do, so he did,
and the people gave him great praise and honor
for it all, and he lived to great age. Kyi! Why
not? He had the beaver&mdash;the water medicine!
It is a powerful medicine to this day!&rdquo;</p>


<p class="break">A visitor in our camp this evening told a tale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
that ill pleases us. There is a tourist camp away
up in Gun-Sight Pass, one of the most weirdly
beautiful places in this whole country. There,
the other day, an employee was putting up a
table on which were painted arrows pointing
to the different mountains, the name of each
peak alongside its particular arrow.</p>

<p>A tourist standing near and watching the
work suddenly exclaimed: &ldquo;Why, over there is
a peak that has no name. Can you not name it
after me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I can,&rdquo; the employee answered;
and painted another arrow and inscribed beside
it: &ldquo;Lehnert Peak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And over there is a fine waterfall,&rdquo; the tourist
said. &ldquo;Will you please name it after my little
daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the man; and painted another
arrow pointing to &ldquo;Mary Frances Falls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Enough said!</p>

<h3><i>September 1.</i></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E moved up here the other day and
made camp beside one of the most
lovely lakes in all this Rocky Mountain
country. In my time we called it Beaver
Woman&rsquo;s Lake. It is now McDermott Lake.
And what a name that is for one of Nature&rsquo;s
gems! There are names for other lakes and
peaks here just as bad as that, but we shall
have nothing to say about them here. Only by
an act of Congress can we get what we want
done, and we have faith that within a reasonable
time all these mountains and lakes and streams
will bear the names of the great chiefs, medicine
men, and warriors who traversed them before
the white men came.</p>

<div class="caption">ICEBERG LAKE<br />
Immense bergs are continually dropping into it from the live glacier in background</div>
</div>

<p>Some of us&mdash;all excepting our two old men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
and the women&mdash;have been riding over the
different trails here, viewing the glaciers and
other places of interest, especially Iceberg Lake,
where we saw a mass of ice as large as a house
part from the glacier, splash down into the deep
lake, and disappear, and after a time come up from
the depths to the surface and create another
commotion of the waters. It was a grand sight!</p>

<p>Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill says that
the lake with the unpronounceable white man&rsquo;s
name&mdash;McDermott&mdash;should be called Jealous
Women&rsquo;s Lake; that away back in the days
of his youth, when the Kootenai Indians occasionally
came to camp and hunt with the Blackfeet,
he had a youthful friend of the mountain
tribe who told him the following story:&mdash;</p>


<h4>THE JEALOUS WOMEN</h4>

<p>&ldquo;In those days a young Kootenai, good of
heart, a great hunter, and very brave, married
twin sisters so alike that except for one thing
they could not be told apart: one was a slow, the
other a very fast, talker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
&ldquo;In time the fast talker, named Marmot, became
jealous of her sister, Camas, complaining
all the time that she had to do the most of the
lodge work, and that she was sure Camas said
bad things about her to their man. Camas
denied all this. &lsquo;I have never tried to place myself
first with our man,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;We are twins;
I love you dearly; our man&rsquo;s heart is so big that
it holds us both in equal love. Now, be sensible!
Cast out your bad thoughts for they are all
wrong.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Marmot persisted in believing that she
was neglected; that her sister had all their
man&rsquo;s affection; and she finally went to him
with her complaint. He laughed. &lsquo;I love you
just as much as I do your sister,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Now,
just think back and show me when and in
what way I have shown that she is first with
me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marmot sat down and thought. She thought
a long time; remained silent. The man was very
patient with her; he waited for her answer, but it
did not come. At last he said: &lsquo;Well, you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
thought a long time. Have you found one thing
in which I gave her preference?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t, but all the same I believe
that you love her best,&rsquo; Marmot answered; and
got up and went about her work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man shook his head, made no answer to
that, and took up his weapons and went hunting
down the river. At the time he was camped right
here at this lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man had not gone far, moving slowly,
carefully, through the timber and brush along
the river, when he heard ahead a great splashing
in the water, and, going closer, found that it was
caused by two otters playing. They would chase
each other in the water, then climb the bank
and go as swift as arrows from a bow down a
slide that they had made, and again chase and
tumble each other over in the water. The man
crept closer to the slide, an arrow in his bow,
another in his hand, and, watching his chance,
shot one of the players. He tried to get the
other, but it dived and was gone before he could
fit the other arrow to his bow: &lsquo;It is too bad that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
I didn&rsquo;t get the other. I would have liked a
skin of these medicine skins for each of my
women,&rsquo; he said to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He took the otter home and handed it to
Camas. &lsquo;That is yours,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;There were
two of them. To-morrow, Marmot, I will get the
other for you, and then you will each have a
strong medicine skin.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marmot said nothing, but looked cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man went hunting the next day but
he could not find the other otter. He searched
the river for many days and could not find
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as the days passed, Marmot became more
and more angry, and finally said to her sister:
&lsquo;I have proof now that our man loves you best.
He gave you the otter; he does not even try to
get one for me. He hunts other animals every
day, bighorn, goats, animals that live nowhere
near the haunts of the otter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be foolish!&rsquo; Camas answered.
&lsquo;You know as well as I do that he has tried and
tried to get the other otter for you. But at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
same time he has to get meat for us: that is why
he hunts the mountain animals.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Camas, the two of us can no longer live in
this lodge,&rsquo; cried Marmot. &lsquo;You are a bad woman!
I hate you! I will fight you any way you say to
see which of us shall be our man&rsquo;s one wife!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it was that, for the first time, Camas
became angry: &lsquo;We have no weapons to fight
with,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;but I propose this: We
will swim this lake across and back and across
and back until one of us becomes tired and
drowns! Now, crazy woman, what do you say
to that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come on! Come on!&rsquo; Marmot cried, and
ran to the shore and tore off her clothes. So did
Camas, and the two rushed into the water and
began their swim of hate. They crossed the lake;
turned and came back; crossed again and started
back, Camas well in the lead. She reached the
shore in front of the lodge, dragged herself out
on the shore, and turned. Her sister had gone
down. There was not even a ripple on the still
water. Marmot was drowned. Hardly knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
what she did, she put on her clothes and went
into the lodge and cried and cried. The man
came home. She was still crying. He asked her
where Marmot was, and she cried all the harder,
but at last told him all. Then the man cried.
Together the two mourned for a long time, and
searched the lake for the body of the lost one,
and could not find it. So they moved away from
the unhappy place and returned to the camp of
their people, but it was a long time, a very long
time, before they ceased mourning, and never
again would they go anywhere near the lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is the Lake of the Jealous Women!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>VI<br />
<span class="smcap">Ni-na Us-tak-wi (Chief Mountain)</span></h2>


<h3><i>September 7.</i></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E came up here the other day to the
foot of this great landmark of the
country, and made camp beside a
running spring in the edge of the timber. The
mountain is most appropriately named. It is the
outer one of an eastward projecting spur of the
range, and is higher than any of the peaks behind
it. A chief, a leader, should always be taller,
more conspicuous in every way than his followers.
This mountain gradually slopes up eastward
from the one behind it to an altitude of
9056 feet, then drops in a sheer cliff several thousand
feet to its steep slope running down to
the plain. From several hundred miles to the
north, and an equal distance to the south, and
from the Bear Paw Mountains to the east, it can
be plainly seen, grim, majestic, a veritable Chief
of Mountains, and for that reason the Blackfeet
so named it in the long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
The way to climb the mountain is by the long,
narrow, and in places cut-walled ridge running
up toward its summit from the west, and then
one has but one cliff to surmount, the one almost
at its crest. Only men and goats and bighorn
can scale that cliff, but on the extreme summit
lies an old buffalo skull, taken there by a Blackfoot
in the long ago for a pillow rest while getting
his medicine dream. There he fasted for days,
and at last, in his weakened condition resulting
from want of food and water, got his vision, his
medicine which was to be his guardian through
life. Who was it that came to him in his fasting
dreams? Ancient Buffalo, perhaps; or, maybe,
Morning Star. Whoever it was, he went staggering
down the mountain and to camp, absolutely
certain that he had found his guardian spirit, his
medium for favor with the greatest god of all,
the Sun, supreme ruler of this earth.</p>

<p>We are here again upon our own ground, the
Blackfeet Reservation, and so once more have
meat in camp, fat bighorn and fat mule deer,
killed by our hunters. This was once a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
wintering place for deer and elk, and, higher up,
for bighorn. Some years ago a hunter, Na-mik&prime;-ai-yi
by name, trailed a band of elk around to
the ridge behind the mountain and up its narrow
way until they came to the foot of the cliff near
the summit and could go no farther. There they
turned back toward him and he fired one shot and
dropped the leader. The others, afraid to try to
dash past him, chose the one alternative: they
rushed to the high cliff there on the north side
of the ridge, and sprang from it, and were all
killed by the fall, eighty head of them!</p>


<h3><i>September 8.</i></h3>

<p>Last night, after our feast of <i>ni-tap&prime;-i-wak-sin</i>
(real meat) we gathered in Yellow Wolf&rsquo;s lodge
for a smoke and a talk, and our host gave us
a little story that I must here set down, the
story of</p>


<h4>THE WISE MAN</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Here, under this mountain, the people were
encamped and two of them were Wise Man<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
and his woman. He was so named because he
was always finding out how to do useful things.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
Mo-k&ucirc;k&prime;-i In-ah. <a href="#FNanchor_13">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Up to the time of this encampment the
people had had nothing to wear but the plainest
kind of garments, shirts, leggins, gowns, moccasins,
all made of plain tanned leather of different
kinds. Wise Man thought long about this,
and finally said to his wife: &lsquo;Let us move away
from camp for a time, and go farther into the
mountains. I have a plan that I want to try
by myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning they packed their dogs
and moved up to the foot of the Inside Lakes,
crossed the outlet, and made camp. Wise Man
then did some hunting, killed plenty of meat
for his wife and the dogs, and began on his
plan for making clothing more pleasing to the
eye. He went up on the high ridge between the
lakes and Little River and dug an eagle trap.
That is, he dug a pit somewhat longer and wider
than his body, and quite deep, and killed a deer
and laid it beside the pit, and slashed its body so
that the liver protruded. He then got into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
pit, covered the top of it with willow sticks and
grass, and waited, hoping that eagles would see
the deer and come to eat it. They did come; he
could hear the heavy swish of their wings as they
sailed down upon it; and as they were eating the
liver he would cautiously reach up, grasp them
by the legs, pull them down into the pit, and
kneeling upon them crush out their life. In this
way, one at a time, he caught many eagles, and
took them home as he caught them, and took
from their bodies the tail feathers, the fluffy
plume feathers, and others that he thought
would answer his purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had a very rank, unpleasant odor, these
feathers; so, when he thought that he had enough
of them, he had his woman cover the floor of the
lodge with a thick layer of sweet sage, upon
which he carefully spread them. He then threw
a quantity of sweetgrass upon the fire, and,
running from the lodge, the two tightly closed
it and kept the smoke inside. This last they did
three or four times until the feathers lost their
bad odor, and were perfumed with the pleasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
odor of sweetgrass and sweet sage, both perfumes
sacred to the gods, as they afterward
learned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Winter was now come, and Wise Man began
to hunt weasels, brown and common of appearance
in summer, but white and beautiful in
winter. This was more difficult work than
trapping eagles, but by setting many snares he
caught during the winter more than a hundred
of them. He then made a headdress of some of
the eagle tail feathers, and suspended from it
a number of weasel skins, and along the seams
of his shirt and leggins tied a number of the
weasel skins. He then put on the headdress and
his ornamental clothes and stood up and asked
his woman how he appeared in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You seem to have become a different man,&rsquo;
she answered. &lsquo;You look very brave, very handsome.
The clothes are beautiful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are of better appearance than they
were,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I am not yet satisfied.
Perhaps I can improve them; but first I have to
do something for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
&ldquo;Wise Man put away his new clothes, and in
old ones hunted elk, taking from them their two
tushes, and in the evening boring holes in the
soft part. Having collected two hundred, he
sewed them in rows on the breast and the back
of his woman&rsquo;s new gown, and both saw that it
was then a handsome gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said the woman: &lsquo;There! We are now complete;
we have fine appearance. Let us go home
and show the people what we have done.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; Wise Man answered; &lsquo;something is
lacking, something that will make our clothes
really beautiful. I have done all that I can without
help, and now I shall ask the gods to show
me what more to do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was the gods that directed his
footsteps the next day. As he was going through
the timber he came upon the remains of a porcupine,
its quills scattered all around upon the
ground. He sat down, took up some and examined
them, and the thought came to him that
they could be dyed different colors and in some
way sewed upon garments and make them of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
brighter hue. He took all that he could find,
and killed several more porcupines, and carried
home all the long quills to his woman and told
her his plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Said she, &lsquo;I know that the yellow moss that
grows on pine trees will stain anything a yellow
that will not fade, that cannot be washed off.
Let us seek for other colors.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sought a long time, finding a green
color in a certain wood, a red in the juice of a
plant, and then they dyed the quills the three
colors. Meantime the woman had been trying
different ways to fasten the quills to leather, and
now, by flattening them, turning in the ends,
and sewing them side by side with very fine sinew
and with the finest of bone needles, she succeeded
in making long bands of them of different
designs in the various colors. She was a long,
long time making them, but at last she made
enough of the bands to sew onto the arms of
Wise Man&rsquo;s shirt, and down his leggins, and
upon the neck front-and-back of her gown.
Each was so pleased with the appearance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
other then that they kissed and almost cried
with joy. Early the following morning they
packed up, crossed the river, and started for the
camp, still here at Chief Mountain. As soon as
they came in sight of it they stopped, put on
their fine clothes, and then went on. The people
saw them approaching, but not until they were
right close to the camp were they recognized.
Then what a crowd surrounded them, staring
at their beautiful garments, asking questions
without end, and as soon as they learned how
this had all been done, they began at once to
gather material for similar clothing. And Wise
Man, of course, became a great man in the tribe,
for to him was due the discovery of the way to
make beautiful things.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><i>September 9.</i></h3>

<p>Although nothing has been said, we have not
been so cheerful as usual for the past few days,
for all have known that we must soon part
and go our several ways. Tail-Feathers-Coming-over-the-Hill
is a sick man, and Yellow Wolf but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
little better, so to-night we decided to break
camp in the morning. To-morrow night each
family will be at home on Cutbank, Willow
Creek, Two Medicine, and Badger, all streams
of the Reservation, and I shall be upon my way
to the Always-Summer-Land.</p>

<p>Well, we have had a pleasant time these past
two months, traveling and camping along our
old trails, and yet the evenings around the lodge
fires have not been of unalloyed joy: all have
been tinged with sad memories of other days;
of deep regret that the old days&mdash;days when we
had all this great country to ourselves&mdash;are
gone forever. And so, to-night, after our quiet,
last evening meal together, we had no story-telling,
no passing of the pipe; none had the
heart for it; and I am writing these last words
by the light of a dying fire, true symbol of the
passing of all things. And now, by its last, blue
flicker, I write&mdash;</p>
